Any such costs (whatever the method used) will be your responsibility.\nIncorrect Fitting\n– The Auto-Trail warranties will not cover water ingress through a component replaced by a dealer/repairer that has been incorrectly fitted.\nNon-Production parts\n– The Auto-Trail warranties will not cover any component or part which was not fitted at the time of production and originally supplied with the motorhome (except replacement parts supplied under an Auto-Trail warranty).\nAssociated costs and business/consequential losses excluded\n– Auto-Trail’s liability under the Auto-Trail warranties is limited to reimbursing the reasonable costs of labour and materials for repair/replacement covered under the warranty concerned (as described above). We will not be responsible under Auto-Trail warranties for any associated costs or expenses which you may incur relating to the problems you have experienced, including (without limitation) replacement vehicle hire or travel costs, hotel or other accommodation expenses, or subsistence costs (such as meals). We will also not pay you compensation for ‘loss of use’. If you use the motorhome for any commercial, business or re-sale purpose we will have no liability to you for any loss of profit, loss of business, business interruption, or loss of business opportunity.\nGENERAL WARRANTY CONDITIONS\n(apply to the Conversion Warranty and Body Integrity Warranty)\nYou must comply with the following conditions to have the full protection from the Auto-Trail warranties described above. If you do not, this may (depending upon the circumstances) result in invalidation of warranty cover altogether, or the amount of your claim being reduced.\nRegistration\n– All new motorhomes must be registered with Auto-Trail at the point and time of registration.\nUK only\n– The Auto-Trail warranties only apply to motorhomes purchased within the UK, and used primarily within the UK. This means that the motorhome must not be used for continuous journeys outside of the UK of longer than 90 days per journey, or exported from the UK.\nMaintenance & servicing.\nIt is your responsibility to ensure that your motorhome is maintained in a legal and roadworthy condition at all times following the manufacturers’ recommended service schedule, (i.e. Fiat for chassis and driveline components, and Auto-Trail’s recommendations for habitation components, fixtures and fittings).\nYou must ensure that the habitation part of your motorhome has an Annual Habitation Service within +/- 30 days of each anniversary of the original date of registration. The 5th Annual Service must be carried out before the expiry of the 60-month period from the original date of purchase. These services must be carried out by an Auto-Trail Service Centre, an Auto-Trail dealer (preferably the original selling dealer) or a VAT-registered AWS (Approved Workshop Scheme) approved workshop. You will be responsible for all charges made for Annual Habitation Services. If the Annual Habitation Service is performed by an Auto-Trail Service Centre then Auto-Trail accepts that the Annual Service has been performed correctly. If the Annual Habitation Service is performed by an unauthorized repairer or service Centre, or if the Annual Service has not been performed in accordance with the requirements of the warranty, or work has been performed on your motorhome that is defective or faulty, then Auto-Trail may not be obliged to perform any work under an Auto-Trail Warranty.\nOriginal VAT invoices, check sheets and damp reports must be retained as proof that all Annual Habitation Services have been carried out, showing the date of the habitation services. It is vital that you retain these documents, as they will be required in the event of a warranty claim; failure to demonstrate you have complied with these servicing requirements will usually invalidate your warranty cover.\nCarry out repairs promptly\n. If any repairs are identified as being necessary to the body shell or habitation areas during an Annual Habitation Service or otherwise, Auto-Trail require that work covered under an Auto-Trail warranty must be performed by an authorized Auto-Trail Service Centre. Repairs should be carried out within 6 weeks of the Annual Habitation Service in which those repairs were identified.\nDriving after an incident.\nYou must not continue to drive the motorhome after any damage or incident has occurred if this could cause further damage to your motorhome.\nGauges.\nIt is your responsibility to understand the warning devices and gauges on your motorhome and ensure that they are operating correctly.\nProhibited Uses.\nYour motorhome should only be used for recreational purposes and must not be the permanent residence for any person, including you or any member of your family. Your motorhome must not be used for hire, reward or commercial use, and race or rally use is prohibited.\nNeglect, misuse, modification or total loss claim\n. Auto-Trail warranties will not apply if the Motorhome has been neglected, misused or subject to unauthorized modification, or if the identification marks (chassis/VIN numbers) have been removed or defaced, or if it has been part of an insurance claim which resulted in a total loss.\nFraudulent claims.\nIf you, or anyone acting on your behalf or with your knowledge or consent has used any fraudulent means, including inflating or exaggerating costs or submitting falsified documents relating to an Auto-Trail warranty claim, then all Auto-Trail warranties for the motorhome will automatically be cancelled. We will in these circumstances also act to recover any previously paid claims and any other loss or damage incurred by us.\nTransfer of warranty\n– If you sell your motorhome, the Auto-Trail warranties are to the vehicle and therefore any proof of service history must be passed from the previous owner to the new owner, otherwise the the vehicle may fall out of warranty.\nLimits of cover.\nOur total liability under all Auto-Trail warranties in respect of a motorhome shall not in any circumstances exceed the original purchase price of the motorhome concerned.\nNo variations\n. None of our employees, dealers, service partners, contractors or agents has the authority to vary, modify or amend any of the terms and conditions of the Auto-Trail warranties.\nWhich laws apply.\nAuto-Trail warranties are governed by English law and you can bring legal proceedings in respect of the products in the English courts. If you live in Scotland, you can bring legal proceedings in respect of the products in either the Scottish or the English courts. If you live in Northern Ireland, you can bring legal proceedings in respect of the products in either the Northern Irish or the English courts.\nWarranty Provider.\nThe name and address of the warranty provider is: Auto-Trail VR Ltd, Trigano House, Genesis Way, Europarc, Grimsby, North East Lincolnshire, DN37 9TU.\nObtaining Warranty Service.\nTo make a claim under an Auto-Trail warranty, please contact your Auto-Trail dealer or NCC approved Dealer.

To drive anything heavier, you’ll need to upgrade to a C1 licence. This involves additional testing and a medical examination.\nIf you’re buying your first motorhome, staying under the 3,500kg limit means avoiding the hassle and expense of upgrading your licence.\nBut it’s not just about legal requirements. The are several other things to consider.\nPros of Choosing a Motorhome Under 3,500kg\nMotorhomes under 3,500kg are popular for good reasons. Here are some key benefits:\nLicence Simplicity\n: With a standard Category B licence, you can drive any\nmotorhome or campervan\nthat weighs less than 3,500kg. There’s no need to worry about taking extra tests or meeting medical requirements.\nBetter Fuel Efficiency\n: Generally, motorhomes under 3,500kg are more fuel-efficient. They tend to have smaller engines and lighter builds, which means lower running costs.\nEasier to Manoeuvre\n: Lighter motorhomes are typically easier to drive and park, especially for newcomers.\nMore Campsite Flexibility\n: Some campsites have weight restrictions for larger vehicles. With a motorhome under 3,500kg, you will have more options when it comes to where you can stay. This is especially true in more remote or rural locations.\nCons of Choosing a Motorhome Under 3,500kg\nWhile there are plenty of advantages, motorhomes under 3,500kg are not for everyone. Here are a few potential downsides:\nLimited Payload\n: One of the main trade-offs for staying under the 3,500kg limit is the restricted payload, or Maximum Authorised Mass. This is the amount of weight you can add to the vehicle in the form of passengers, luggage, and equipment. For larger families or those who like to travel with a lot of gear, this could be a dealbreaker.\nSmaller Living Space\n: Motorhomes under 3,500kg usually have more compact living spaces. If you are planning extended trips or want a lot of room to stretch out, you might find these models too cramped.\nFewer Luxury Features\n: Larger motorhomes over 3,500kg often come with additional luxury features. For example, larger kitchens, bathrooms, and more advanced entertainment systems. While many motorhomes under 3,500kg are still comfortable, they might not have all the high-end features you are after.\nAll Auto-Trail Campervans are Under 3,500kg\nIt’s worth noting that all\nAuto-Trail campervans\nfall under the 3,500kg limit. So, if you are thinking of opting for a campervan instead of a motorhome, you won’t need to worry about licence restrictions.\nWhen You Might Consider a Motorhome Over 3,500kg\nFor some, there are times when you might want to consider a larger motorhome. Here are some situations where upgrading to a motorhome over 3,500kg might make sense:\nYou Need More Space\n: If you’re planning long trips or\nliving in your motorhome full time\n, the extra space and amenities of a larger vehicle can make a big difference. Larger motorhomes often come with full-sized kitchens, bigger beds, and more storage.\nYou’re Travelling with a Large Group\n: For families or groups, a motorhome under 3,500kg might not be big enough. A larger motorhome can provide more sleeping areas, seating, and room for everyone.\nYou Want More Features\n: High-end features like king-sized beds, bigger water tanks, and advanced technology are often only available in larger motorhomes. If luxury is a priority, it might be worth upgrading your licence to access these models.\nYou Don’t Mind Taking the C1 Test\n: Upgrading to a C1 licence isn’t as difficult as it sounds. If you’re want a larger motorhome, it’s worth going through the process of upgrading your licence.\nReady to Find Your Perfect Motorhome?\nWhether you’re sticking to the 3,500kg limit or considering something larger, we have a motorhome for every adventure.

    "content": "Living in a Motorhome or Campervan Permanently in the UK\nTravelling in your motorhome offers a unique lifestyle, packed with freedom and adventure.\nIf you have caught the bug, you might wonder,\n‘Can I live in a motorhome permanently in the UK?’\nIn this article, we’ll explain everything you need to know.\nKey Takeaways\nIt is legal to live in a motorhome full time provided you meet certain conditions.\nThere are several pros and cons to living full time in a motorhome. You should consider each very carefully before committing to it.\nThere are other considerations to think about, including, access to services and facilities, time limits on where you can stay and your environmental impact.\nIs it Legal to Live in a Motorhome Permanently in the UK?\nYes, it is perfectly legal to live in your motorhome or campervan full time in the UK, as long as;\nYou have the legal right to live in the UK, and\nYour campervan or motorhome is road legal. This means it’s taxed, insured and registered it with the DVLA, it has a valid MOT (if required), and you have\na valid driving license\n.\nThe Pros and Cons of Living in a Motorhome Full Time\nLiving in a motorhome full time has lots of benefits. But there are also plenty of downsides too.\nThe Pros of Living in a Motorhome\nThe benefits of living in a motorhome include;\nFreedom to Travel\nThis is often the biggest reason why people ditch the house to live in a motorhome. You have the freedom to travel where you want, knowing that no matter where you are, you have your bed with you.\nThis means you can wake up to a different view every morning if you want to.\nLower Cost of Living\nHouses are expensive to own. Mortgages, rent, utilities, council tax, it all adds up.\nWhile motorhomes aren’t cheap, they’re not as expensive as bricks and mortar to own. You will have costs; camp sites, fuel, insurance, and maintenance, but they won’t be as high as owing and living in a house.\nCloser to Nature\nThere’s nothing quite like living in the great outdoors.\nBeing closer to nature does wonders for\nour mental wellbeing\n. Many people who live in motorhomes have a better mood, less anxiety and have a happier life in general.\nLess Space to Clean\nIf you’re like us, there are lots of things you’d rather do than cleaning. Especially when you’re off exploring the world.\nThe good news is that motorhomes have limited space, which makes them easy to keep clean. Even a big clean only takes a couple of hours, giving you more time to spend doing the things you want to.\nOpportunity to Meet New People\nWhen you travel, you’ll meet and make friends with lots of new people. From other people living the van life, campground hosts, hikers, and the people who live in the areas you visit.\nIt’s also amazing of how often you come across people you’ve met in other places.\nThe Cons of Living in a Motorhome\nThe downsides to living in a motorhome include;\nLimited Space\nWhile having limited space is a bonus if you’re not a fan of cleaning, the lack of space can be a strain for some.\nYou’ll have to share the same toilet and bathroom and your beds will be close to each other so there’s a lack of privacy.\nAlso, while motorhome make good use of space, storage is limited. So it doesn’t take a lot to make a small space messy.\nDriving Can Be Difficult\nMotorhomes are big vehicles which can make travelling around quite difficult. Especially in locations you’re not familiar with.\nIf you’re not a confident driver, you might think twice about moving into a motorhome.\nProblems with Parking\nParking your motorhome\nisn’t always straightforward, especially in the UK. Different councils have different rules on parking, so you need to make sure you understand them.\nWhen parking on private land, you’ll need to get the landowners permission.\nThat said, there are plenty of apps and Facebook groups that help you find a place to park.\nNo Fixed Address\nIf you decide to live in a motorhome, you’ll have no fixed address. This can make other areas of your life difficult.\nCollecting post, registering with a GP surgery or dentist, insurances and getting on the electoral register can be problematic.\nOne option is to redirect your mail to a family or friend. There are also companies that rent mailboxes. The motor homing community always have helpful tips.\nRegardless, there may be times when you receive financial, medical or other sensitive documents in the post. As such, you need to make sure your personal information is kept safe and secure.\nView Our Motorhomes\nFind your perfect Auto-Trail motorhome. From budget-friendly models, long distance tourers, to luxury A-Class motorhomes.\nView Our Motorhomes\nOther Things to Consider Before Living in a Motorhome\nBefore deciding whether living in a motorhome is right for you, here are some other things to consider;\nPlanning Permissions\nDifferent local authorities have different regulations on the use of residential vehicles. Some even require planning permission to use a motorhome as a permanent address.\nSo check with council to make sure you understand the rules where you’re residing.\nServices and Facilities\nWhen living in a motorhome, you’ll need access to water, electricity as well as sanitation and waste disposal.\nDepending on where you’re staying or plan to visit, you might not always have access to them. So planning is essential.\nTime Limits on Campsite and Stopovers\nThe UK has lots of campsites and places to stop over. That said, many have restrictions on how long you can stay.\nYour Impact on the Environment\nWhile the environmental impact of living in a motorhome is less than owning a house, it doesn’t mean there isn’t one.\nThe first is the amount of fuel you use. If you’re on the move a lot, it goes without saying, you’ll burn more fuel.\nThe lack of storage space in a\nmotorhome or campervan\nalso means buying singular items. This means more trips to the shops and therefore more fuel burnt. It also can increase the amount of plastic waste you produce.\nAnd the more waste you produce, the more trips you’ll make to waste disposal point’s (if you’re not on a campsite). Again, this means more fuel consumed.\nView Our Campervans\nFind your perfect Auto-Trail campervan. Whether you’re a first time tourer, looking for sporting adventures, or holidaying with your family, we have a campervan for you.\nView Our Campervans\nIn Conclusion\nBefore committing to the Van Life, it’s super important to consider the pros, cons and the practicalities of living in a motorhome.\nHolidaying in your motorhome and living in it on a permanent basis are very different. So do your research and think very carefully before jumping in.\nRelated Guides\nBUYING GUIDE\nCampervans vs Motorhomes: Which Should I Choose?\nBUYING GUIDE\nHealth benefits of owning an Auto-Trail motorhome or campervan\nBUYING GUIDE\nLiving in a Motorhome or Campervan Permanently in the UK"

    "title": "Overnight Parking and Stopovers in Your Motorhome or Campervan | Auto-Trail",
    "content": "Overnight Parking and Stopovers in Your Motorhome or Campervan\nOne of the best parts of owning a\ncampervan\nor\nmotorhome\nis that\n‘home is where you park it’\n.\nParking up overnight or ‘\nstop overs’\nmeans you can get some sleep without the cost of a campsite. However, there are laws and overnight parking and they’re not always very clear.\nThis guide covers everything you need to know for a safe and practical overnight stay.\nKey Takeaways\nMotorhomes and campervans fall under the same class as caravans, so the same laws apply.\nDifferent councils in the UK have different bylaws which makes it hard to know where you can stay.\nScotland has a different set of rules which makes it even more complicated.\nParking illegally overnight could result in being woken up and moved on, and sometimes a fine.\nOvernight parking and wild camping are very similar with a subtle difference.\nEurope is a little more accommodating to motorhomers and campervanners.\nThere is a range of apps and Facebook groups available for finding motorhome overnight parking spots.\nThe Laws Around Overnight Parking\nUK law defines motorhomes and campervans the same as caravan.\nSection 29 (1) of the Caravan Sites and Control of Development Act 160\ndefines a caravan as;\nAny structure designed or adapted for human habitation which is capable of being moved from one place to another (whether being towed, or by being transported on a motor vehicle or trailer)’.\nAs a result, many laws that apply to caravans also apply to motorhomes and campervans.\nHowever, there is a lot of confusion around overnight parking laws. This makes it hard to know where you can park legally.\nSo you can’t just pull up and anywhere and park overnight. Doing so could mean being woken up and moved on in the middle of the night by the police, local authority, or angry landowner.\nIn some cases, it could also result in a fine.\nAnd to make matters even more complicated;\nDifferent councils in the UK have different bylaws, and\nScotland has its own set of rules that are different to the rest of the UK\nEngland and Wales\nRegulations in England and Wales can be stricter compared to Scotland. Follow local bylaws and avoid residential streets unless clearly allowed.  National parks like the Lake District and Dartmoor have specific regulations to follow.\nScotland\nScotland is more flexible with its wild camping laws. The\nScottish Outdoor Access Code\n, allows for responsible access to most land. This including some overnight stays in vehicles. The Highlands and more remote areas are ideal for wild camping under this code.\nNorthern Ireland\nNorthern Ireland follows similar regulations to England and Wales. Local bylaws and specific rules in protected areas. Coastal regions and popular tourist spots may have extra restrictions.\nShop Motorhomes\nFind your perfect Auto-Trail motorhome. From budget-friendly models, long distance tourers, to luxury A-Class motorhomes.\nView Our Motorhomes\nAre Overnight Parking and Wild Camping the Same Thing?\nOvernight parking and wild camping are very similar. Both mean sleeping in your\ncamper or motorhome\nwithout having to pay but there’s a difference between the two;\nOvernight parking\n– refers to finding a safe place to park and sleep that’s free-of-charge.\nWild camping\n– is parking in a remote or secluded spot where there are no other motorhomes.\nWhat About Motorhome Stopovers in Europe?\nThe EU tried to be more accommodating to motorhomers and campervanners. The allow wild camping in several national parks and also on private land if you can get permission.\nSeveral countries have designated areas for overnight parking called\n‘Camper Spots’\n.  They range from lay-by’s, car parks, and even beaches. Some even have facilities like drinking water, toilets and electric hook-up.\nThat said, many of these camper spots have limits on how long you can part there. Often 48 hours.\nShop Campervans\nFind your perfect Auto-Trail campervan. Whether you’re a first time tourer, looking for sporting adventures, or holidaying with your family, we have a campervan for you.\nView Our Campervans\nHow to Find Places That Allow Overnight Motorhome Parking\nTo make sure you stay on the right side of the law when parking up for the night, there are various apps and social media communities you can use.\nCampercontact App\nCampercontact\nhas over 50,000 motorhome sites in 58 countries, over 3,500 are UK stopovers. It also has over a million members.\nIt allows you to check the most recommended parking places and get route ideas. If you upgrade to the pro version of their app, you can use it offline.\nSearchforSites App\nSearchforSites\nhas over 47,000 places to park overnight. It also has an active community of over 330,000 members who provide information and update reviews.\nThey have a mobile app with built-in sat nav which you can try for three days at no cost. After that it costs just £7.49 a year. Again, you can use their app offline.\nPark4Night App\nPark4Night\nis an app that lists various places to park your motorhome or camper overnight. It includes lay-bys, supermarket car parks, fields and campsites.\nTheir £10-a-year fee means you can use their app offline if you don’t have internet access.\nYou can also install Park4Night on TomTom, Garmin and iGo satnavs for an added (but reasonable) fee.\nBrit Stops App\nWhen looking for places to park overnight in the UK, the Brit Stops app is excellent.\nBrit Stops is a network of more than 1,100 independent businesses where you can park up for the night. They include farm shops, pubs, and other attractions.\nTheir current membership is £35.20 per year.\nCampervan Overnight Parking Facebook Group\nThe\nCampervan Overnight Parking Facebook group\nhas 124,000 members. It’s an active community with members sharing their reviews of different stopovers, from off-grid locations to campsites.\nYou’re also free to ask questions and get involved in discussions.\nMotorhome Sleepy Spots Facebook Group\nThe\nMotorhome Sleepy Spots Facebook Group\nis quite a bit smaller with around 35,000 members. It’s also not quite as active but you can use it to find up-to-date information on where to spend the night across the UK and Europe.\nUK Motorhomes Stopovers\nUKMotorhomes.net\nhas a huge list of\n‘non campsite’\novernight parking stopovers for the UK.\nEach listing has a Streetview map and GPS co-ordinates and any other relevant information about the location.\nOvernight Parking Do's and Don’ts\nOvernight parking is exactly that. You’re parking your vehicle overnight, not camping, so with that said here are some do’s and don’ts.\nDon’ts:\nPitch a tent\nWind out your awning\nHang out your laundry\nCook on your BBQ\nCause an obstruction\nDo’s:\nplan your stops in advance\nKeep noise to a minimum\nPark safely\nBe curious of your surroundings\nLeave the areas as (or tidier) you found it\nLock your doors\nSumming Up\nThe laws and rule about overnight parking and motorhome stopovers are confusing. But don’t let that stop you from trying it out.\nWith our list of apps and resources, finding a stopover is easy, convenient, and fun.\nRelated Guides\nBUYING GUIDE\nLiving in a Motorhome or Campervan Permanently in the UK\nBUYING GUIDE\nCampervans vs Motorhomes: Which Should I Choose?\nBUYING GUIDE\nHiring Motorhomes and Campervans in the UK: The Ultimate Guide"

Habitation services can take place at Auto-Trail or one of our approved workshops, but chassis services must take place at a Fiat or Ford approved workshop (model dependent).\nIt is your responsibility to ensure that your motorhome is maintained in a legal and roadworthy condition at all times following the manufacturers’ recommended service schedule, (i.e. Fiat for chassis and driveline components, and Auto-Trail’s recommendations for habitation components, fixtures and fittings).\nThe recommended schedule for both your habitation service and your chassis service is as follows:\nHabitation service\n: Your Habitation Service must be completed annually, within +/- 30 days of each anniversary of the original date of registration (Please refer to the Terms and Conditions).\nFiat:\nEvery two years or 30,000 miles, whichever comes first.\nFord:\nEvery twelve months or 12,000 miles, whichever comes first.\nApproved workshops\nOur approved workshops are committed to providing the highest quality care for your Auto-Trail motorhome or campervan. They use genuine Auto-Trail parts, have experienced technicians, and offer a range of services to keep your vehicle in great condition.

    "content": "Corporate Responsibility\nEnvironmental impact is one of the biggest priorities at Auto-Trail, and something which we remain constantly mindful of.\nSteps Taken\nWe have taken several steps to becoming a more environmentally friendly and sustainable organisation:\nLights across our 16-acre headquarters and production facility have been replaced with LED versions, reducing light-related greenhouse gas emissions by 80%.\nRainwater is harvested and diverted into our bathrooms to use when flushing toilets. With almost 250 members of staff on-site, this greatly reduces our water consumption and demand on local resources.\nWe have further reduced our water consumption by installing ecocaps in urinals. These innovative devices hold an enzyme that breaks down the liquid and negates the need for the cisterns to be flushed more than three times a day.\nOur on-site biomass boiler is fed with wood waste, which it burns and turns into energy that heats our factory. This method is far more sustainable than using fossil fuels, and helps reduce the waste that we send to landfill.\nWe operate condensed working hours from Monday to Thursday, saving staff commuting money and reducing their carbon emissions. For three days each week, we do not need to turn on machinery, lights, heating or use water, therefore reducing our organisational carbon footprint too.\nElectric vehicle usage is championed, with a salary sacrifice scheme available to staff members who wish to use it. Electric vehicle charging points have been installed at the factory to make charging more convenient for both staff and visitors.\nOur commitment to working as sustainably as possible means that we are constantly monitoring and evaluating our environmental impact. A culture of accountability ensures that our efforts remain effective and we continue to look for new ways to improve.\nAnti-Slavery Statement\nThe Modern Slavery Act, 2015 was introduced to help eradicate slavery, forced labour and human trafficking in the operations and supply chains of companies.\nView statement"

    "content": "What Licence Do I Need to Drive a Motorhome?\nOne of the key questions to answer before you buy is: ‘What Driving Licence Do I Need to Drive a Motorhome?’\nIn this guide, we’ll break down;\nWhat types of motorhomes you can drive with your current licence, and\nWhether you need to take any extra steps to drive your dream vehicle.\nMotorhome Model\nWeight\nLicence Needed\nExpedition Coachbuilt C63\n3,500kg / 3,650kg upgrade\nCategory B / Category C1\nExpedition Coachbuilt C71\n3,500kg / 3,650kg upgrade\nCategory B / Category C1\nExpedition Coachbuilt C72\n3,500kg / 3,650kg upgrade\nCategory B / Category C1\nExpedition Coachbuilt C73\n3,500kg / 3,650kg upgrade\nCategory B / Category C1\nF-Line F60\n3,500kg\nCategory B\nF-Line F62\n3,500kg\nCategory B\nF-Line F68\n3,500kg\nCategory B\nF-Line F70\n3,500kg\nCategory B\nF-Line F72\n3,500kg\nCategory B\nF-Line F74\n3,500kg\nCategory B\nExcel 620G\n3,500kg\nCategory B\nExcel 620S\n3,500kg\nCategory B\nExcel 675B\n3,500kg\nCategory B\nExcel 690L\n3,500kg\nCategory B\nExcel 690T\n3,500kg\nCategory B\nImala 615\n3,500kg / 3,650kg upgrade\nCategory B / Category C1\nImala 730\n3,500kg / 3,650kg upgrade\nCategory B / Category C1\nImala 736\n3,500kg / 3,650kg upgrade\nCategory B / Category C1\nImala 736G\n4,500kg\nCategory C1\nFrontier Delaware\n4,500kg\nCategory C1\nFrontier Scout\n4,500kg\nCategory C1\nFrontier Comanche\n5,000kg\nCategory C1\nGrande Frontier GF-80\n4,500kg\nCategory C1\nGrande Frontier GF-88\n5,000kg\nCategory C1\nUnderstanding Driving Licence Categories in the UK\nThe type of vehicle you can legally drive depends on the category of your licence and the weight of the vehicle. Here’s a breakdown of the key licence categories you need to know about:\nCategory B (Standard Licence)\n: If you passed your driving test after 1997 and have a standard Category B licence, you can drive a motorhome with a Maximum Authorised Mass (MAM) of up to 3,500 kg. This category covers most\ncampervans\nand smaller motorhomes. As such, a category B license is fine for first-time buyers.\nCategory C1\n: If you’re looking to drive a larger motorhome with a MAM between 3,500 kg and 7,500 kg, you’ll need a C1 licence. This licence requires additional testing, which we’ll cover later.\nCategory C\n: For those planning on driving a vehicle over 7,500 kg, such as large commercial motorhomes, you’ll need a Category C licence. This is less common for most recreational drivers. Most motorhomes fall under the Category B or C1 weight limits.\nWhat About Pre-1997 Licence Holders?\nIf you passed your driving test before 1st January 1997\n, you may already have a C1 licence entitlement. This means you can drive motorhomes up to 7,500 kg without needing to take any further tests.\nWhat is Maximum Authorised Mass (MAM)?\nMaximum Authorised Mass\nis the maximum weight a vehicle can legally be when fully loaded. This includes passengers, fuel, water, and cargo.\nMAM is crucial when determining if your licence covers the motorhome you want to drive. You’ll find the MAM listed in;\nThe vehicle’s documentation, or\nOn a plate located in the engine compartment or inside the door\nIf you have a standard Category B licence, you should always keep the 3,500 kg weight limit in mind. If the motorhome exceeds this weight, you’ll need to upgrade to a C1 licence.\nUpgrading Your Licence: Do You Need to Take a Test?\nIf your dream motorhome is over 3,500 kg, upgrading to a C1 licence is a straightforward process. Here’s what you’ll need to do:\nBook a C1 Driving Test\n: To get a C1 licence, you’ll need to pass a medical exam and take a specific test for vehicles between 3,500 kg and 7,500 kg. You can\nbook this test\nthrough the DVLA or at a local driving test centre.\nMedical Requirements\n: As part of the C1 application, you’ll need to undergo a medical assessment. This is to ensure you’re fit to drive larger vehicles. This is a basic health check, and your GP can complete the necessary forms.\nTest Structure\n: The C1 test consists of both a practical driving and a theory test. The theory test will assess your knowledge of driving larger vehicles. The practical test will evaluate your handling of the motorhome.\nCost and Time Commitment\n: On average, upgrading to a C1 licence costs between £200–£300 to acquire. This includes the medical exam, test fees, and any necessary training. The process can take several weeks depending on test availability and your preparation time.\nOnce you’ve passed the C1 test, you’ll be able to drive larger motorhomes up to 7,500 kg.\nOther Considerations: Trailers, Towing, and Driving Abroad\nIf you’re planning on towing a trailer behind your motorhome, there are other rules to keep in mind. For most standard Category B licences, you can tow a trailer if the combined weight of the vehicle and trailer doesn’t exceed 3,500 kg. If it does, you’ll need to upgrade to a C1+E licence, which allows you to tow heavier loads.\nWhen driving abroad, weight limits can vary between countries, especially within the EU. As such, it’s essential to check the local driving regulations for the countries you plan to visit.\nBrowse Our Range of Motorhomes\nNow that you know what licence you need, you’re one step closer to hitting the open road in your perfect motorhome.\nExplore Our Range\nFind a Dealership"

    "content": "Campervans vs Motorhomes: Which Should I Choose?\nLife on the road is the essence of freedom and adventure, but the journey begins long before you turn the ignition. It starts with choosing the right travel companion: a campervan or a motorhome.\nBoth campervans and motorhomes promise a lifestyle of exploration and discovery. Yet cater to different styles of travel, depending on your needs and preferences.\nThis guide looks at the differences between campervans and motorhomes. We’ll discuss the pros and cons of each and help you make an informed decision about which is best for you and your travels.\nUnderstanding the Difference Between Motorhomes and Campervans\nBefore diving into the specifics, let’s clarify what we mean by campervans and motorhomes.\nCampervans\nSmaller than motorhomes, campervans are built on a van chassis. They’re more compact and easier to manoeuvre. Their design prioritizes efficient use of space for sleeping, dining, and cooking.\nBenefits include;\nSmaller than motorhomes, making them easier to drive and park.\nBetter for driving on narrow roads.\nPerfect for weekend warriors, spontaneous trips, and short-term getaways.\nAccepted on more campsites than some motorhomes.\nGenerally cheaper to buy and maintain than motorhomes.\nYou can also use them as a daily driver.\nView Our Campervans\nFind your perfect Auto-Trail campervan. Whether you’re a first time tourer, looking for sporting adventures, or holidaying with your family, we have a campervan for you.\nView Our Campervans\nMotorhomes\nMotorhomes present a step up in size and amenities. They’re built on larger chassis and provide a more comprehensive\n‘\nhome-on-wheels\n‘\nexperience. Perfect if you want more space and comfort. They come in various sizes, from small Class B vehicles to large Class A motorhomes.\nBenefits include;\nMuch more living space than motorhomes, including separate areas for dining, sleeping, and relaxing.\nLots of storage capacity for gear, food, and possessions.\nHigh-end features like full kitchens, entertainment systems, and sometimes even washer/dryers.\nMore sleeping arrangements to accommodate larger families or groups.\nIdeal for family holidays.\nView Our Motorhomes\nFind your perfect Auto-Trail motorhome. From budget-friendly models, long distance tourers, to luxury A-Class motorhomes.\nView Our Motorhomes\nSo, Which Should You Choose, Motorhome or Campervan?\nIf you’re still undecided between a campervan or motorhome, this should help.\nChoose a Campervan If\nYou prefer short trips and weekend getaways\nThere is only two of you and you don’t need space for a family\nYou don’t have the budget for a large motorhome\nYou don’t want to have to\nworry about parking\nand height restrictions.\nChoose a Motorhome If\nYou prefer longer breaks or visiting more remote places\nYou want to holiday with family or friends\nYou like to take the comforts of home with you\nPrefer a more luxurious camping experience\nWhy Not Try Hiring First?\nRegardless of where you end up choosing a campervan or motorhome, the cost is significant.

    "title": "Motorhoming in Europe with Your Dog | Auto-Trail",
    "content": "Motorhoming in Europe with Your Dog\nA dog is for your on the road life, and not just for home… You don’t have to leave your pooch ‘back at the ranch’ or in kennels just because you’re going off on holiday. It’s possible to take your dog with you when you\ntravel abroad in your motorhome\n, just the same as taking him or her with you when you’re on these shores for a staycation.\nThese are the steps you should take:\nThink of the Dog\nFor a while, forget everything ‘admin’ or organisational around the issue of\ntaking your dog abroad\n– it’s important to put the dog right at the centre of your thinking. Consider what the dog’s needs will be throughout the journey. Some dogs are really good travellers and will happily sit in the back or the boot of your car, but they may only have been on relatively short trips and are not used to much longer distances. You should always take a favourite blanket or toy, as something familiar that they know the smell of will help a dog settle.\nMake a list of things you need for the dog before you set off – things like feeding bowls, toys, poo bags, lead, etc. As a side note, here, it’s not legal to take meat-based dog food out of the country. In addition, you should think about how your dog is going to travel. It’s not a good idea to allow them to roam free, as it’s dangerous all round. Make regular stops along the way so that the dog can have a walk about (and can go to the loo).\nThink, too, about the environment you will be taking the dog to, and any steps you can take to ensure that this is safe. Going from the UK to the heat of the south of France, for instance, could be ‘a bit much’ for the dog, so research the weather in advance and check out the\nRSPCA website\n, which offers a helpful guide on welfare. There is even a section specifically on the signs and effects of heatstroke.\nHealth Rules and Responsibilities\nhere are different rules on taking a dog in a motorhome in an EU country than there are for taking it into a country outside of the EU. If you are travelling with your dog in your motorhome to an EU country (or into Northern Ireland), you will need various things for your dog. These include a microchip, a valid rabies vaccination (these must be up to date and done at least 21 days before you travel), an\nanimal health certificate\nor\nvalid pet passport\n. You must also double-check whether the individual requirements of each country you intend to visit go beyond this list (for instance, you must keep a dog on a lead at all times during shooting season in Finland).\nThe dog must also have been treated for tapeworm. If you’re going out of the UK, the dog must be tapeworm treated by a vet before you go, and you must wait 24 hours before re-entering the country. You also must return within 120 hours (five days) or you’ll need to get the dog seen by a vet abroad for another tapeworm treatment (this will be recorded in the dog’s passport or health certificate). Within four weeks of returning home to the UK you must get your dog treated again. Under current regulations this tapeworm treatment isn’t necessary if you’re coming directly from Finland, Ireland, Northern Ireland, Malta or Norway.\nAt the domestic level, you should think about how you are going to keep your dog clean and tidy while you are on your holiday. If your motorhome has an external shower, then that is perfect for cleaning off your beast after a day of rolling around in the sand or getting dirty in some muddy forest. Motorhomes with garages also provide a great space in which you can clean up your dog, as they are tucked away from the interior of the motorhome, so your furry friend isn’t going to make a mess of the upholstery in the living quarters!\nWhen you go on holiday, the main aim is usually to indulge in some serious rest and relaxation, and it’s great if the family dog can be a big part of this time away from the strains of normal domestic life. However, remember that your dog thrives on routines and will be looking to you to ‘set the tone’ – so don’t skimp on their usual meal times and their usual walk and exercise times. Keep a thought for the dog’s welfare and you shouldn’t have any problems taking them abroad. Happy travels!"

    "content": "Hiring Motorhomes and Campervans in the UK: The Ultimate Guide\nBeing able to ‘Try Before You Buy’ is a great way to get familiar with the motorhome or campervan lifestyle, and has great benefits that will drastically impact and improve your final purchase decision.\nIf you’re considering purchasing your dream motorhome or campervan, hiring one first is a convenient way to test-drive life on the road.\nThis guide will steer you through the benefits of hiring a motorhome or campervan, including how to do it and why it’s so crucial to experience different layouts before making a purchase. We’ll also discuss dealer offers on motorhome hire that you may not be aware of!\nWhy Try Before You Buy?\nTo Experience Different Layouts.\nAuto-Trail’s vast range of\nmotorhomes\nand\ncampervans\ncome with a variety of layouts, each offering different living and sleeping arrangements. Hiring allows you the flexibility to test these layouts to find what works for you and whoever else may accompany you on the road. The\nAuto-Trail F-Line range\nis a great example of a range that suits various travel needs – with so much differentiation, you want to be sure your chosen layout suits you.\nTo Understand Your Needs.\nIt’s important that the leisure vehicle you purchase gives you unforgettable and effortless journeys, and trying before you buy gives you a taste of the motorhome lifestyle. Whilst hiring you can assess the storage space (like the rear strut boot in the\nV-Line Sport range\n), kitchen facilities, and driving comfort, ensuring the model you choose meets your travel requirements.\nFor Cost-Effective Decision Making.\nPurchasing a campervan or motorhome is an investment. Hiring first helps to avoid costly mistakes by ensuring the model you choose is the right fit. Auto-Trail’s range is extremely customisable with several options available to tailor a vehicle to your tastes, so going into the purchase with some lived-in experience will make a world of difference.\nTry Before You Buy Offers\nSome dealers offer hire purchase schemes.

    "content": "Health benefits of owning an Auto-Trail motorhome or campervan\nIn recent years, the allure of van life and the freedom of exploring the great outdoors has captured the hearts of many adventure seekers.\nAmong the diverse range of motorhome brands available, Auto-Trail stands out as a reliable and trusted choice for those seeking unforgettable UK and European travel experiences. In this blog post, we’ll explore the health benefits of owning an Auto-Trail motorhome or campervan, both mentally and physically.\nEmbrace an active lifestyle\nOwning an Auto-Trail motorhome or campervan opens up a world of opportunities for embracing an active and healthy lifestyle. From the rugged terrains of the Scottish Highlands to the picturesque trails of the Alps, your motorhome becomes a comfortable and convenient base camp, allowing you to explore the great outdoors on your terms.\nCycling adventures:\nFor cycling enthusiasts, Auto-Trail motorhomes and campervans offer unmatched convenience. Equipped with ample storage for bikes, you can easily transport your bicycles and equipment, embarking on thrilling cycling adventures. Picture yourself riding along the stunning coastal roads of the UK or tackling iconic cycling routes in Europe, such as the legendary Mont Ventoux in France or the scenic Trollstigen in Norway. With an Auto-Trail motorhome or campervan, you have the flexibility to choose your cycling destinations and immerse yourself in the beauty of nature. The Expedition 68 campervan is designed specifically for those with a passion for cycling: the perfect companion for your road biking, mountain biking and BMX endeavours. It features a large garage with slide-out bike trays for up to four bikes and can sleep two to four people.\nHiking escapes:\nWith the Auto-Trail range, you can seamlessly transition from the open road to rugged trails. The spacious interior of the motorhomes ensures comfort and relaxation after a rewarding day of hiking. Whether you’re conquering the mesmerizing peaks of Snowdonia in Wales or exploring the idyllic landscapes of the Swiss Alps, your Auto-Trail motorhome becomes your sanctuary, allowing you to recharge and unwind in nature’s embrace. Perfect for hiking is the F-Line F60, featuring a large rear bathroom to clean off in and drop-down electric bed which lifts out of the way of a large front lounge in the daytime. At just 5.99m in length, this motorhome is easy to park even in the smallest of spaces. Handy upgrade options include gas BBQ point, wi-fi, television and 170bhp automatic engine.\nClimbing thrills: If climbing is your passion, Auto-Trail provides the ideal solution for taking on new challenges. With its robust design and exceptional versatility, the V-Line Sport range of campervans can transport all your climbing gear, making it effortless to reach your favourite crags and cliffs. Whether you dream of scaling the imposing cliffs of Dorset’s Jurassic Coast or tackling the famous El Capitan in Yosemite National Park, your Auto-Trail campervan provides a comfortable retreat and a hub for planning your next vertical adventure. Unique to V-Line Sport models is a rear top hinged gas strut boot, giving plenty of space to store equipment, boots and climbing clothes away from the main living space.\nMental health benefits\nWhile the physical health benefits of owning an Auto-Trail motorhome or campervan are evident, the positive impact on mental well-being should not be overlooked. Van life and the freedom to explore the UK and Europe offer a myriad of mental health benefits, and Auto-Trail plays a crucial role in facilitating these advantages.\nEscape from everyday stress:\nLife can be hectic, and sometimes we all need an escape from the daily grind. Owning an Auto-Trail motorhome or campervan allows you to break free from the routine and immerse yourself in the beauty of nature. Whether you’re parked near a tranquil lake in the Lake District or nestled among the picturesque mountains of the Austrian Alps, the serenity of your surroundings provides a much-needed respite, helping to reduce stress and promote relaxation.\nConnection with nature:\nSpending time in nature has been proven to have a positive impact on mental health. Auto-Trail motorhomes and campervans enable you to establish a deep connection with the natural world. Wake up to the sound of birds chirping, breathe in the crisp mountain air, or witness a breathtaking sunset from the comfort of your vehicle. Being immersed in the beauty of nature can improve mood, reduce anxiety, and foster a sense of tranquillity and peace.\nSense of freedom and adventure:\nVan life represents a sense of freedom and adventure, both of which are essential for mental well-being. With an Auto-Trail motorhome or campervan, you have the flexibility to choose your destinations, change plans on a whim, and embrace the spontaneity that comes with the open road. This sense of freedom can invigorate the spirit, boost self-confidence, and ignite a thirst for exploration, leading to a more positive outlook on life.\nSocial connections:\nAuto-Trail motorhomes provide opportunities for building social connections with like-minded individuals. Whether you join motorhome clubs, attend gatherings, chat in online forums or simply strike up conversations with fellow travellers at campsites, van life fosters a sense of community. Sharing stories, experiences, and tips with others who share your love for adventure and the great outdoors can contribute to feelings of belonging and enhance social well-being.\nTime for reflection and self-care:\nOne of the luxuries of van life is the abundance of personal time and space. Auto-Trail motorhomes and campervans offer a private sanctuary where you can engage in self-reflection, practice mindfulness, and prioritize self-care. Whether it’s reading a book under the shade of a tree, practicing yoga at sunrise, or simply enjoying a quiet moment of solitude, these moments of introspection can promote mental clarity, emotional balance, and overall well-being.\nEmbarking on an adventure with an Auto-Trail motorhome or campervan opens up a world of health benefits, both physical and mental. From the exhilaration of cycling through breathtaking landscapes to the tranquillity of spending time with nature, the freedom that owning an Auto-Trail gives you is great for the soul. So, embrace the open road, explore the wonders of the world, and embark on a journey that nourishes both your body and mind."

    "content": "Auto-Trail F-Line: A Case Study\nOne of the most exciting motorhome ranges for 2023 is Auto-Trail’s coachbuilt F-Line. Across six models, each with high specification, the F-Line offers up excellence time and again. These six sleek and aerodynamic builds are\nFord motorhomes\n– constructed on the new EcoBlue Ford Transit chassis and range from 5.99m to 7.32m in length. The F-Line has several different layout features across these six models.\nF-Line F60\nThe large rear washroom and ergonomic kitchen make for an inspiringly spacious interior in the most compact F-Line model. The F-60 is the perfect motorhome for couples to make a home from home while they’re out on the road – though the option of an electric drop-down bed offers the chance for more than two to travel – or, you’ll be able to make the most of the living area without having to convert the seating when it’s bedtime.\nF-Line F62\nThere are no fixed beds in the F62, which offers plenty of living space. The L-shaped kitchen is towards the rear of the vehicle, with the washroom also on one rear-side. This layout gives a more ‘opened up’ feeling, with plenty of space for everyday living.\nF-Line F68\nThis sleeper for two is a great motorhome for entertaining as well as exploring. A wrap-around lounge at the rear feels huge, offering a truly comfortable social space for when you have guests over, or want to spread out when you’re chilling out! With a washroom on the driver’s side of the F68 and a kitchen area towards the middle on the non-driver side, this is a really well put-together model.\nF-Line F70\nWith fixed rear twin beds and an electric drop down bed over the living area towards the front of the vehicle, this four-berth F70 is a versatile layout, ideal for busy families. The Auto-Trail F-70 also has decent sized kitchen area and washroom with a separate shower as part of its cleverly designed interiors.\nF-Line F72\nWith a wraparound lounge at the rear and a second social space up front, the F72 is brilliant for families looking to spend quality social time within their vehicle, or adults and kids who want to gain a little privacy. The F72 is one of the largest in the F-Line range and features a clever interior design to maximise the space.\nF-Line F74\nThe four-berth F74 features a large island bed at the rear of the vehicle.\nMotorhomes with an island bed\noffer an almost bedroom feel, as a rule, which can be handy for those who require a little more feeling of privacy. The F74 has a washroom just in front of the ‘bedroom’ for easy access, and there is also a kitchen area to the centre of the F74 and a good-sized social space towards the front.\nDiscover Today\nEach model in the F-Line has its own special features, and you can investigate these further by taking a look on our website. This vehicle is expertly designed to give couples or small families the most comfortable and convenient experience possible, without compromising on quality.\nIf you have a bigger family and are on the lookout for a\nlarge motorhome\n, then maybe an\nA-class motorhome\nis for you instead – but, if it’s reliable performance and well thought-out homely interiors that you’re after then perhaps there’s nothing better than an Auto-Trail F-Line model.\nAt Auto-Trail, as well as\nFord motorhomes\nwe also stock\nFiat campervans\n– there’s plenty on offer to choose from to make sure you get the right vehicle. If you’d like to know more please don’t hesitate to contact us, and a member of our friendly team will be more than happy to help!"

    "title": "The Types of Motorhome Explained | Auto-Trail",
    "content": "The Types of Motorhome Explained\nWhen looking to buy a motorhome for the very first time, the sheer amount of choice can be overwhelming. As a result of the rising popularity of staycations in recent years, many buyers are looking to get their hands on a new motorhome, a lot of them for the first time.\nYou may have seen many more motorhomes on the road and, with the market expanding, it’s important to firstly understand the different types of motorhome, the main features, and whether they are likely to suit both you and your budget.\nThere are three main types of motorhome:\nA-Class Motorhomes\nA-class motorhomes\nare renowned for being the most luxurious option on the market. As the classification featuring some of the largest vehicles on offer,\nA-class motorhomes\noffer plenty of interior space, which means they are great family vehicles. It’s not uncommon to find\nA-class motorhomes\nwhich sleep up to six people – perfect if you are looking to travel with children or guests and over long distances.\nThese motorhomes are known for offering a great variety of sleeping options, from fixed island double beds to electric drop down beds, giving you the ultimate home-from-home experience. If it’s maximum storage you’re after, many\nA-class motorhomes\nhave their own spacious garages, perfect for storing all that outdoor gear. However, garages can also be a feature of many smaller motorhomes, such as sporty-style campervans or some of our coachbuilt models.\nAs explained in a previous blog, there are so many benefits that come with owning an A-class motorhome. However, it’s important to bear in mind that many\nA-class motorhomes\n– though not all – have a maximum laden weight in excess of 3,500kg, which means that they cannot be\ndriven on a standard category B driving licence\nand an additional licence may be required. So, it’s not common to choose an A-class as a starter vehicle.\nCoachbuilt Motorhomes (C-Class Motorhomes)\nIf you’re looking for a more affordable option, still with plenty of space, a coachbuilt motorhome may be for you.\nCoachbuilt motorhomes\n, sometimes called\nC-class motorhomes\n, are built with a cab or cutaway chassis, often with sleeping and living space for up to six people. Offering a number of clever design layouts, with bathrooms, double beds, large kitchen facilities and integrated storage space,\ncoachbuilt motorhomes\nare packed with home-from-home living features. Low-profile type\ncoachbuilt motorhomes\ndon’t have a projection over the front cab, making for a more aerodynamic design. Many of the coachbuilt designs have swivel cab seats, giving the same sociable feel as an A-class for those who want a more manageable vehicle. Our specialty lies with\ncoachbuilt motorhomes\nhere at Auto-Trail, with five impressive ranges to choose from including the Auto-Trail Expedition and the Auto-Trail F-Line.\nPanel Van Conversions\nPanel van conversions remain a popular choice, showcasing smart solutions where no centimetre is wasted. They have room for all the family, sometimes with a pop-top roof for extra sleeping space. Often, panel vans are proof that being on the smaller side doesn’t mean compromising on the high-spec interiors that can be found in A-class and\ncoachbuilt motorhomes\n. Panel van conversions are a great option which double up as an everyday vehicle if you’re worried about financing another vehicle. The ultimate no-fuss vehicle, the panel van conversions are large enough to live comfortably, but small enough to manoeuvre, even for the most nervous of drivers. We stock a number of panel conversions with up to four berths, including the Auto-Trail Adventure range and the Adventure.\nHopefully we’ve given you an insight into the types of motorhomes on the market. Spend some time thinking about your requirements, whether you’ll be travelling with a family, how far you’re likely to be travelling at any one time and determine a realistic budget. Find your nearest Auto-Trail stockist today to see some of our exceptional motorhomes in person to help you come to your decision."

    "title": "The Best Motorhomes for Sports & Cyclists | Auto-Trail",
    "content": "The Best Motorhomes for Sports & Cyclists\nHeading off in a\nmotorhome, campervan or caravan\nand enjoying familiar shores – as well as going deep into countryside and other terrain inland – is one of life’s true pleasures.\nThe rise of the staycation\nTo some people, the rise of the staycation in the last few years may have seemed like a bit of a negative – no foreign beach, no fun. But those of us who already knew and appreciated how wonderful the British Isles is, had no such qualms about staying closer to home for our breaks and holidays.\nDrive your vehicle to a favourite spot, take out your bike and ride to your heart’s content, enjoying the scenic surroundings. There are\ncompact campervans\navailable, as well as larger models, which will suit adventure-oriented cyclists. At\nAuto-Trail\n, our specifically designed sports model is the\nAuto-Trail Expedition 68\n, which. This luxury\nadventurer’s camper\ncan transport four people and four bikes – so that impressive capacity means cycling holidays with friends or family have never been more easily accessible.\nSlide-Out Trays for Storing Bikes\nIt’s possible to get bikes into most\nleisure vehicles\n– whether it’s putting them in the living area during travel (which may be effective but isn’t really convenient or desirable), or into the boot area. In the latter case you’d lift or roll them in, but the\nAuto-Trail Expedition 68\nis a game-changer, as you slide bikes in and out on a pair of gear trays (optional). These innovative trays offer more convenience and ease of use than other methods, and mean that a pair of bikes are really neatly and efficiently packed into the rear of the\ncampervan\n. It’s possible, with a little bit of careful planning, to store four bikes – so that’s everyone on your trip taken care of!\nInside the Auto-Trail Expedition 68\nThe\nAuto-Trail Expedition 68\nfeatures a convenient interior floorplan which, despite a few tweaks to elevate it above the norm, will seem instantly familiar to every\ncampervan lover\nwho steps inside. It will act as the perfect hub for your adventure operations, whether it’s as base camp from which to plan the day’s activities in the morning over a coffee, or a comfortable crash pad for landing at the end of a long day out in the saddle.\nLiving in the Auto-Trail Expedition 68\nFor maximum convenience the front driver and passenger seats rotate to face into the\nbody of the campervan\n(though not while driving, of course!) and, positioned just behind the driver’s seat is the passenger lounge featuring dual bench seat and table. Comfortably seating four for social moments, then, is straightforward in the\nAuto-Trail Expedition 68\n. USB points, upper lockers and thermal pleated blinds and fly-screens to all opening windows add convenience to the comfort.\nLiving needs are amply catered for too, with a kitchen on the passenger side featuring an oven/grill combo alongside a dual-burner stove, sink and 12v fridge/freezer – plus plenty of storage for provisions as well as cutlery and pots and pans etc. On the driver’s side behind the lounge is the\nExpedition’s washroom\n, which features a shower and electric flush toilet. Chrome taps and a large mirror add a nice aesthetic.\nHeating and hot water are standard, with an all-in-one from Whale. Mounted under the chassis for space-saving efficiency, the system can be run on electricity when on electric hook up (EHU), or on gas (provided by a 6kg propane bottle in the locker provided, with space for two).\nSleeping in the Auto-Trail Expedition 68\nThe\nAuto-Trail Expedition 68\ncan be converted into a\nfour-berth campervan\nby going for the optional ‘pop top’ – a pop-up roof which accommodates a 79” x 51” double bed. The main bed – the rear double bed – lies over the garage area, and stretches the width of the\ncampervan’s body\n. At the rear of the vehicle, the dual doors make up ‘the back wall’. The doors can, of course, be left open at night and a zip-up mesh panel used to create a notional physical/privacy barrier – albeit one which will allow you to enjoy the very best of weather conditions. The bedroom area also features overhead cabinets and a wardrobe so users will have plenty of storage options for clothing and bits and pieces of personal equipment.\nIn full this back bed measures 74” x 55” and, because it is lower than in many other\ncampervans\n, sleepers will get a bit more headroom and general bedroom space. There is, however, a minor side-effect of being this generous with space. Bikes stored below will need to have a wheel taken off before storage (and put back on before riding). Although for some this is not ideal, these days most bikes have very easy wheel release mechanisms, and taking a wheel off or refitting is a regular part of being a cyclist – certainly not the huge engineering deal it was years ago!\nPower and Performance of the Auto-Trail Expedition 68\nThe\n2023 season Expedition 68\nfeatures a smart, modern exterior look, finished in matt\nExpedition Grey\n, rather than standard white. Based on a Fiat Ducato chassis, the\nExpedition\nfeatures a 140bhp engine (though a 180bph engine upgrade is available with automatic gearbox only). This power improvement means hauling your extra gear is no problem at all for this\ncapable campervan\n.\nMotorhomes for Sports\nAs one of modern life’s great pleasures – great for the body, great for the mind – cycling is only ever going to get more and more popular. It’s increasingly important to make sure you have a vehicle which can take you, your friends and your bikes out to the right environments so you can follow this passion for wheels, pedals and saddles.\nAuto-Trail’s Expedition 68\nis that vehicle.\nWhether you are interested in motorhomes for sports or\ncampervans for quick getaways\n, Auto-Trail provides options. From motorhomes with garages to small\nmotorhomes under 3,500kg\nas well as\ncampervans\nconverted to incredible specifications, we have something to suit you. You can\nbrowse our website\nto see what we have to offer – or, if you prefer,\ncontact us\nto discuss your particular needs and a member of our team will be more than happy to help you hone in on a vehicle which meets your needs.\nRelated guides\nBUYING GUIDE\nMotorhomes Under 3,500kg: Everything You Need to Know\nBUYING GUIDE\nWhat Licence Do I Need to Drive a Motorhome?\nBUYING GUIDE\nMotorhome and Campervan Essentials: Your Ultimate Packing List"

    "title": "The Benefits of Choosing an A-class Motorhome | Auto-Trail",
    "content": "The Benefits of Choosing an A-class Motorhome\nA-class vehicles are considered the premium choice in the motorhome world.\nWhere quality meets luxury, A-class motorhomes are some of the biggest on the market. Only the so-called toterhome, built on a heavy-duty truck chassis and capable of towing large trailers, exceeds it. With plenty of space to offer, the\nA-class\nhas many of the features and amenities you can expect to find in your own home. By comparison, class B motorhomes are panel van conversions, commonly known as campervans. Class C vehicles, although implying a reduction in size, are in fact coach-built vehicles which are typically bigger than class B, with an over cab for sleeping. If you’re wondering if an\nA-class\nvehicle is the right choice for you, this guide gives you all you need to know.\n5 benefits of owning an A-class\nSpace\nPerhaps the most sought after\nbenefit of an A-class motorhome\nis the space it has to offer. Averaging at 10 metres (30 ft) in length and 2.5 metres in width (8 ft 6 in),\nA-class\nmotorhomes\noffer larger showers, more lounge space, full kitchen units, and additional beds. Not only this, but they also sleep up to 6 people, which makes them a great option if you have children, pets, or simply want more space when travelling long distances or for longer periods of time. With space also comes more storage, allowing you to create the ‘home from home’ you’ve perhaps always been looking for. This combination of space and storage allows for premium comfort, providing the most luxury touring experience.\nBetter insulation\nWith an\nA-class motorhome\n, you get a fully insulated coach-built vehicle. If you’ve ever avoided those winter getaways, it may be time to consider an upgrade!\nGreater windscreen visibility\nGiven the much larger windscreen that comes with a larger vehicle, you can expect greater visibility. Many drivers prefer this option as it allows them a better view, enabling them to feel more in control, whilst taking in the beauty of the open road.\nGarage\nFancy your very own garage space? Perhaps you have your own motorbike but are currently unable to take it away in your current motorhome? Externally accessible garages in\nA-class motorhomes\noffer plenty of space for all those outdoor accessories. They are also disability friendly, with a ramp to allow easy loacding and offloading. There’s also the option to convert them into an additional room – perhaps an office, or something fun such as a games room.\nFull width cab\nThis feature adds to the flow of the motorhome. Spanning the full width of the vehicle, the cab feels part of the living space, giving an integrated and homely feel.\nThings to think about:\nSometimes, an\nadditional driving license\nmay be required for vehicles over 3500kg. However, many A-class vehicles sit under 3500kg, so can be driven under the standard license.\nSize:\nGiven their size, many\nA-class motorhomes\nare noticeably larger to drive and feel wider on the road. If you’re not a confident driver, this is something to be aware of. You can take the motorhome on a test drive to gauge whether or not it’s for you.\nA-Class Motorhomes at Auto-Trail\nDue to growing demand, here at\nAuto-Trail\nwe have created the all-new Grande Frontier. The sleek sophisticated design with 4 berths. The range sees 3 new models, all promising spacious living areas and a luxury finish.\nAuto-Trail Grande Frontier GF-70\nComing in at 6.93m, the GF-70 is the most compact of the 3, ideal for couples wishing to experience luxury whilst escaping from busy life.\nAuto-Trail Grande Frontier GF-80\nSlightly larger at 8.07m in length, the GF-80 is equally stunning. Showcasing a new integrated media centre and hydronic central ALDE heating, this motorhome is sure to impress anyone that views it.\nAuto-Trail Grande Frontier GF-88\nTop of the range, and also the largest at 8.79m the GF-88 features high quality amenities and appliances. Create your home from home with a large front dining area and large rear island double bed, this model is perfect for longer trips away, or simply to enjoy maximum comfort.\nIt clear that\nA-class motorhomes\nare the top choice on the market, with all you could ever need for any trip, long or short.

    "title": "Feeling Flat? Motorhome Around Lincolnshire For a Lift! | Auto-Trail",
    "content": "Feeling Flat? Motorhome Around Lincolnshire For a Lift!\nWhen you have invested in a luxury motorhome you really need somewhere special to take it. Why not Lincolnshire? This great county has lots of places worthy of your time, so we’re going to suggest a few in this edition of our blog, and we hope you enjoy what you find when you get there…\nLincoln Cathedral\nApproaching its 1000\nth\nanniversary (in around 50 years’ time),\nLincoln Cathedral\nwas commissioned by William the Conqueror and is one of Europe’s finest examples of Gothic architecture. For a couple of centuries in the Middle Ages it was also the tallest building in the world! Positioned right in the centre of the city and trimmed by tight roads (so you’ll really need to park elsewhere and travel in), the Cathedral offers guided tours included with admission – a great way to explore this awe-inspiring building.\nIn far more modern times the Cathedral was the focus of global attention when The Da Vinci Code, starring Tom Hanks and Audrey Tautou, directed by Ron Howard and based on Dan Brown’s controversial best-selling novel, was filmed there. A nun maintained a vigil in protest, which gained huge media coverage. Just a stone’s throw away is Lincoln Castle, similarly, steeped in history.\nWater’s Edge and the Ropewalk, Barton-upon-Humber\nIf natural, rather than human history is your thing, then this unassumingly great (and free to enter) visitors centre positioned on the south bank of the river Humber could be just the place. It’s a haven for friendly ducks, wading birds and more, and there’s a series of walks around ponds, which take you through reed beds, woodlands and wildflower meadows.\nYou’ll also get some spectacular views across the river towards the city of Hull, and the visitor centre itself is packed with information about the area.\nWater’s Edge\nis very close to\nthe Ropewalk,\na stunning arts centre developed inside an old nautical rope works. There are always exhibitions and events to attend, as well as a café to get cosy in.\nTed Lewis and Chad Varah, Barton-on-Humber\nOnce you’ve taken in the Ropewalk and Water’s Edge you might want to dig into Barton’s relatively recent cultural past. Cult author Ted Lewis was raised in the town, eventually moving to London and working as an animator (notably on\nYellow Submarine,\nThe Beatles cartoon film) and a writer, penning a couple of novels including noir crime thriller\nJack’s Return Home.\nHe moved back to the area and wrote for TV (including Z-Cars and an unproduced Doctor Who story) but died of alcohol-related causes in the early 1980s. The Ted Lewis Centre celebrates his life and work and, of course, his connection to the area. Jack’s Return Home was set in nearby Scunthorpe. Of course, the story became more widely known as\nGet Carter\n– and the 1971 film adaptation, set in Newcastle and starring Michael Caine, is regarded as a classic.\nChad Varah, the founder of the Samaritans, a charitable organisation helping those with depressive or suicidal feelings, was born in Barton. Interestingly, this clergyman was also one of the founders of the very popular comic\nThe Eagle,\nwhich featured spaceman Dan Dare in stories he scripted.\nAviation Heritage Centre\nThis stunning museum near Spilsby was set up in 1989 and capitalises on the area’s military aircraft heritage – there were close to 50 active airfields in the county by the end of the Second World War (the legendary Dambusters took off from this area).\nThe Aviation Heritage Centre\nhouses a great collection including some of the rarest remaining aircraft from the mid 20\nth\n-century, including an Avro Lancaster Bomber MKVII. It’s possible to book a taxi ride on the Lancaster (known as Just Jane) which will give you a vivid insight into the conditions endured by airmen during bombing campaigns. Not as comfortable as the\ntwo berth motorhomes\n(the F-line or the Tracker) you’d get from Auto-Trail we’d wager!\nGrantham\nAn unassuming but interesting place notable over the last four or five decades for originating Margaret Thatcher, the controversial first female Prime Minister, and the modern punk band Sleaford Mods, who stand fervently against just about everything ‘the Iron Lady’ stood for. There is, though, more to Grantham than just a divisive politician and a great rabble-rousing band. Nearby\nWoolsthorpe Manor\nwas home to Sir Isaac Newton, the physicist who formulated the laws of motion and gravity. You may have heard of the story of an apple falling from a tree and Newton’s theory being inspired? The apple tree is right here at Woolsthorpe!\nDoddington Hall and Gardens\nSituated a few miles outside of Lincoln, the Grade I listed\nDoddington Hall\nwas built between 1593 and 1600 and is a fantastic example of Elizabethan architecture. The beautiful parklands and gardens surrounding it are Grade II listed. Doddington is open to the public, and there are opportunities for private tours.\nEpworth\nThis small Lincolnshire town was the birthplace of John and Charles Wesley, founders of the Methodist church movement in the 18\nth\ncentury. Their family home, the Rectory, has been fully restored and is now a museum to their religion.\nWith a population of just 4,000 or so,\nEpworth\ncould be described as ‘sleepy’ – but in the early 1980s it certainly wasn’t… England cricket captain Ian Botham lived here (also playing professional football for local league side Scunthorpe United in his spare time). On a night off during the legendary 1981 Test Match against Australia at Headingley (when all sorts of records were broken, and miracles occurred) Botham hosted a legendary party at his house. It ended in the ‘late early hours’ of the morning with what he has politely described as “a scrum” between English and Australian players! The house he lived in still stands, and cricket fans sometimes visit to pay quirky homage to this bygone era of their favourite sport.\nEpworth was also childhood home to popular light entertainment TV actress and West End star Sheridan Smith. There are also a couple of great pubs and restaurants here – and if you pop in you might see Smith as she often visits family who still live here.\nLincolnshire, apparently the country’s flattest county, actually has so much to offer for those interested, whether that’s taking the whole family or as a couple in a\nsmall\ntwo berth motorhome\n. We’d be hard pushed to include it all in one simple blog. We’ve listed a handful of the sites we think have some ‘extra value’ for one reason or another – but we’d also like to recommend that you check out the towns of Market Rasen, Cleethorpes (a great seaside resort), Woodhall Spa, Mablethorpe, Brigg… The list goes on!\nIf you’re looking for a new motorhome to set out on your next adventure, find your nearest Auto-Trail stockist today!"

    "title": "Ways to keep your leisure vehicle cool in a heatwave | Auto-Trail",
    "content": "Ways to keep your leisure vehicle cool in a heatwave\nWe use our campervans and motorhomes more in the summer, so it makes sense to work out ways to keep cool in temperatures which can soar as high as 40°C.\nSo here are some tips on how to reduce the heat inside your Auto-Trail leisure vehicle\nLook for a pitch in the shade\nIf you can keep your home in the shade for all or part of the day, the sun’s rays will have less of an opportunity to heat the structure and interior. If you are unable to shield from the sun for most of the day, position your home so that it is in shade for the afternoon or evening, which will provide shade when the temperature is likely to be at its highest.\nIf you are unsure of the direction of the sun when you arrive on site, ask your neighbours, or alternatively download a sun position app on your phone which will show the path of the sun.\nExtend any awnings to shade the wall of the vehicle\nA simple idea requiring a little planning when you first park up. Try to figure out which way is south and put your awning on that side if possible. The more sun you can keep off the side of your motorhome, the cooler it will feel inside. This is also, a useful tip for touring abroad.\nOpen at least two hatches or windows to allow airflow in your campervan/motorhome\nThe more airflow you can get into your van, the better. Opening hatches and windows on both sides helps to create airflow, which in turn helps your motorhome feel cooler. Try to open them on opposite side or ends to encourage even more air movement. Allowing fresh air in can also stop condensation and mildew in your van.\nKeep blinds closed or use a screen\nKeep your motorhome blinds or hatch screens closed. If you have a reflective screen, use it. Just stopping a little light will help reduce the interior temperature dramatically.\nPlan your cooking\nUsing a hob, grill or oven in your motorhome is just going to make things even warmer inside. As much as possible, try to cook outside so the heat does not build up. If you like a hot drink on a hot day, then try use a gas burner outside instead of the hob or kettle inside.\nDon’t forget, many campsites either do not allow BBQ’s or they insist they are kept off the floor. Make sure you ask ahead of your visit as you may need to invest in a firepit or stand or a BBQ with legs.\nse 12v portable fans to keep a motorhome cool in summer\nYou can use several 12v portable fans in the van to help move air around and keep things feeling cooler. If you have pets, this is great way to keep them cool.\nKeeping pets cool\nProviding water for pets to lie or play in can be a great way to help them keep cool. Other ways to help pets cope include offering cool surfaces to lie on and frozen treats such as carrots and kongs. Please do not feed them ice cubes as this can be dangerous, and don’t walk your pets during the hottest part of the day. Cool coats, bandanas and mats are all great aids to keeping temperatures low.\nKeep hydrated\nOur last tip is aimed at you rather than the leisure vehicle itself. Drinking plenty of fluid keeps your body cooler in high temperatures. Fruit juice, soft drinks and drinking lots of water (2-3 litres per day) will keep your body cool."

    "title": "Travelling to Scotland in a motorhome | Auto-Trail",
    "content": "Travelling to Scotland in a motorhome\nTravelling by motorhome is a great way to see Scotland, touring miles of famous tourist routes, destinations, and trails along the way. There is so much to see and do in Scotland, it’s a great idea to plan out your trip so you can make the most of your time, to make as many memories as possible.\nA staycation is a great way to explore what your own country has to offer and can be the perfect holiday choice if you’re on budget, but still want a change of scenery.\nHere are some helpful tips and guidelines to keep in mind:\nRoad safety rules and driving etiquette:\nNo matter where you drive in the world, it’s essential you check the country’s rules and regulations to keep you and other drivers safe. Be aware of your vehicle measurements, if you’re not used to driving a larger vehicle, take extra precautions. Make sure you use roads that will be wide enough to fit your vehicle and b aware of your length too! Motorhomes can often have a rear overhang and reversing cameras do not always account for bike racks. Driving etiquette is key! As you are a larger vehicle, and likely slower, allow traffic to overtake you.\nAt Auto-Trail we have the optional extra, ‘motorhome specific’ satellite navigation included in both campervan and motorhome enhancement packs. By having a motorhome satellite navigation it allows you to able to plan suitable specific itineraries and that contains specific points of interest (POIs) which come in very useful for motorhome drivers.\nWeather:\nWeather is important, as the forecast can change quickly in Scotland, meaning there could be hazardous driving conditions such as heavy rain, snow, and ice. Make sure to pack for the seasons, including winter essentials such as a shovel, de-icer, warm clothing and extra food and water.\nAlthough motorhome drivers are less vulnerable in the sun and heat, the summer period can take its toll on the vehicles themselves. According to\nwww.campingandcaravanningclub.co.uk\ntheir advice for driving a motorhome is the following:\nThe softened road surface can get slippery if there is rain after a dry period, causing vehicles to lose grip.\nHigher temperatures can exacerbate any existing damage your tyres may have, especially if they are under-inflated. Punctures and blow-outs may occur, so it’s vital that your tyres are sufficiently inflated.\nCheck the tyre walls for cracks, and consider fitting Tyron safety bands which will help you maintain control in the event of a blow-out. You might also consider fitting a tyre pressure monitoring device, which alerts the driver to overheating tyres.\nIf the vehicle’s cooling system isn’t working properly, it could run the risk of overheating. Make sure the fan and coolant hoses work and check the coolant level.\nPlan ahead:\nScotland has a great range of places to stay in your campervan or motorhome and it is always advised that you use official campsites or designated overnight parking areas. This is to help preserve Scotland’s natural landscape and reduce as much disruption to local resident areas as possible. There are hundreds of campsites in beautiful scenic settings, complete with facilities and docks for your motorhome. Check which accommodation sites are open or closed, as well as designated overnight parking areas.\nIn Loch Lomond and the Trossachs National Park there are official lay-bys that form part of the roads network, allowing drivers to stop and rest on their journey, including overnight. In these locations you do not require a permit to stop overnight, but these short stay options are not designed for extended stays. Within the National Park there are designated areas where it is possible to enjoy a longer stay, but it is advised you purchase a motorhome permit online first. Make sure you stay somewhere that isn’t on private property, near or beside someone’s residence or blocking roads or driveways. To find out more and to book a permit visit:\nwww.lochlomond-trossachs.org/things-to-do/camping/get-a-permit/\nEvery morning you can wake up to the magnificent mountains with the Scottish forest, be beside one of Scotland’s stunning loch’s or by an ancient castle on a historical site. Add this to excellent facilities and you’ve got a combination for a perfect break.\nVisit Scotland have recommended some beautiful motorhome spots, visit:\nwww.visitscotland.com/blog/accommodation-ideas/stunning-motorhome-spots/\nScottish Outdoor Access Code:\nRead up on the\nScottish Outdoor Access Code\nso you can be as eco-friendly as possible and learn about how you can leave no trace. Before driving away from your pitch, leave it exactly as it was when you arrived. Do not light bonfires or barbeques and take extra care around natural hazards when outdoors.\nWaste:\nIf you have any waste you need to dispose of, most campsites or caravan parks will have general waste and recycling facilities where you can manage this appropriately. For your waste water this can dispose at the designated disposal point on site\nWild Camping:\nIf you like being off the beaten track and don’t mind sacrificing the usual day-to-day comforts and would like to explore areas of Scotland that very few visit. Then wild camping is for you. It’s a great way to discover remote and stunning landscapes and being close to nature. It definitely comes with a great feeling of adventure!\nFor more information visit,\nwww.visitscotland.com/accommodation/caravan-camping/wild-camping/"

    "content": "Five reasons touring is the best way to see the world\nThe world is a big place with an abundance of interesting, fun, relaxing, or life-changing places to visit. Our freedom and ability to travel is something that many of us now have a better understanding of the value of since the COVID-19 pandemic.\nGoing touring might not have been something that you had previously thought about, but it is certainly an option that you should seriously consider. And here’s why…\nIt’s about the Journey\nThe late\nRalph Waldo Emerson\nonce said, “it’s not the destination, it’s the journey”. There is so much that you can see and do whilst you’re on your way somewhere, so why not make the travelling part of it into the main bit of your trip?\nTours are exactly this. You might not even have a particular destination in mind, but the joy is in the travel, the places that you visit on the way, and the experiences that you have.\nFreedom\nOne of the biggest reasons that touring is a great option is because it gives you the\nfreedom\nto go where you want when you want (and with the soundtrack of your choice). By driving a motorhome or caravan you can travel at your own speed, stay as long as you like and see everything there is to see. You’re not held down by a stringent itinerary of pre-booked flights and hotel reservations and can take control of your own travels.\nCaruno believe\nthat it’s the driving aspect that is key: “driving can be a chance to unwind, be in our own space and refocus” they explain.\nTravelling is about escapism, doing new things, and going to new places, and this is all the sweeter when it’s off your own back.\nEnvironmentally Friendly\nWe are all increasingly looking for ways that we can help to reduce our impact on the environment – and one of them is reducing the amount that we’re flying. A road trip is a fun, adventurous, and eco-friendlier alternative – especially if you’re taking other people along with you. “While even driving alone would be better from the standpoint of greenhouse-gas emissions, carpooling makes the most environmental sense”\nsays ThoughtCo.\nTravel, in itself, is said to make people more conscientious of the environment, nature, and the impact that we are having on the environment. Touring is a great way to get out there and back to your routes without compromising on comfort.\nBonding\nBy spending long amounts of time with people, you can create a special bond with them. Whether it’s visiting inspiring landmarks, sharing spiritual places, or just whiling away the hours on the open road chatting, taking a road trip is a great way to nurture a friendship or partnership.\nTravelling can change our points of view, teach us things about ourselves that we did not previously know, and give us a perspective on things that we otherwise wouldn’t have had. And this also applies when you are travelling with friends or loved ones.\nYour own Adventure\nWhether you cherish meeting local people, travelling into the wilderness, or visiting the less touristic parts of the world, touring is a perfect solution for anyone who needs a bit of adventure in their life.\nBy taking control of your own journey, you can go off the beaten track, meet real people along the way, and create your own tailor-made trip. You can visit places that are undiscovered on the tourist trail, and experience things that may not be accessible to regular tourists.\nWhether you’re looking for freedom, an eco-friendly option, or just for some special time with loved ones, a road trip in a campervan or motorhome is the ideal solution for some time away. It is your chance to get amongst nature, experience the world, and make some memories that will last forever."

    "content": "Read our handy packing guide to help you prepare for your next Spring getaway…\nDays are getting longer, flowers are blooming and holiday excitement is in the air! Planning a motorhome getaway this Spring doesn’t need to be stressful, which is why we have put together a handy packing guide just for you.\nFirst thing’s first – understanding your leisure vehicle’s maximum weight limit. This is hugely important because driving over the maximum weight could invalidate your insurance and lead to prosecution if you are involved in an accident.\nHow do I find out the maximum weight of an Auto-Trail vehicle?\nIt couldn’t be easier! Simply open the bonnet using the lever inside the passenger door and you will find the maximum weight written inside.\nHow do I use the maximum weight to work out how much luggage I can pack?\nWhen you purchased your Auto-Trail vehicle, you would have been given some paperwork with a ‘mass in running order’ weight on it. This includes everything needed to drive the vehicle (fuel, driver, engine fluid etc.)\nThe difference between your maximum weight and mass in running order weight is called the ‘motorhome payload.’ In other words, this is how much additional weight you can add to the vehicle before it becomes illegal to drive.\nAbsolutely anything you add to the vehicle is included in your payload figure (e.g. luggage, additional passengers, food, water, gas, pets, bikes, towels etc).\nTop Tip:\nUse our online\nweight calculator\nto help you work out your remaining payload!\nWhat is the best way to load a motorhome for stress-free travel?\nIn simple terms, go from bottom to top and start with the heaviest and bulkiest items first. Things like bikes, dog crates, outdoor furniture etc. are always the most awkward to fit in, so make sure they are secure before thinking about smaller items. It is also a good idea to get breakables in and secure early on.\nWeight distribution is important – you don’t want all the heavy items to one side or end of the vehicle. The heaviest items are best situated between the axles and the tyres should be inflated to the fully laden condition.\nWhen putting items in cupboards, the tighter you pack them, the less likely they are to slide about. Also make sure to bring your most used items to the front for easy access. Tea towels are a great way to stop cutlery and pans rattling as you drive.\nOnce everything is in, close and secure all lockers, cupboard doors, roof lights, drop leaf tables and sinks, windows, fridge and gas bottles. Tables should be stored in the dedicated storage area (if your vehicle has one). Turn off the gas bottle at the isolation valve in the LPG compartment* and switch the fridge to 12V. Leaving curtains and blinds open is always a good idea to aid visibility when driving.\nIt might be worth driving down your road and back and testing the brakes to make sure everything stays where you put it!\n*Your vehicle may be fitted with a special type of regulator that allows the gas to remain turned on whilst you are driving. Your dealer will be able to advise you about this.\nTop Tip:\nSNACKS! If you are doing a long drive or just want to make a short one more enjoyable, remember to keep some snacks and drinks in the cab.\nI’m ready to go!\nCongratulations, the hard work\npacking everything\ninto the van is complete and we hope you have a wonderful time on your getaway.\nNot sure what music to listen to on the way? We have created the\nultimate road trip playlist\nto get you in the motorhome holiday mood. View it here and make sure to download it to your phone if you have limited mobile data."

    "title": "The Great Escape & the Spirit of Adventure | Auto-Trail",
    "content": "The Great Escape & the Spirit of Adventure\nBlur once sang of the need to ‘get out of cities’ – and by doing so it seemed that this Britpop band truly understood the importance of escaping an urban environment to embrace the great outdoors. They even named an album after the idea of removing yourself from the rat race completely, even if just for a holiday or weekend break – 1995’s\nThe Great Escape\n.\nMore than quarter of a century on, the music may be gone but one particular way you can still ‘get out of cities’ remains: investing in a campervan or motorhome. This home-from-home vehicle can take you right out of the routine of normal life into a space where your mental and physical wellbeing can be subtly recharged.\nIn this edition of our blog we’re going to focus on\nAuto-Trail campervans,\nspecifically one tailored to suit outdoor adventurer types. People who like to get out into the wilds and make the most of what the countryside has to offer. Action-oriented families who like to take off on spontaneous trips to the beach or anywhere else far from the concrete jungle. It’s not just about functionality and utility, though – it’s also packed with enough comfort to keep everyone happy at the end of each day’s adventures…\nExterior of the Adventure, plus other features\nFrom the outset, the\nAuto-Trail Adventure\nwows. Built on the Fiat Ducato, the Adventure range is available in a choice of five different Fiat colours, featuring exclusive stylish decals for a truly eye-catching look. Diamond cut alloy 16” wheels and a black coded front grille top off the cool image, with a 140bhp engine fitted as standard (with options available). Both models are fitted with a solar panel as standard (wattage dependant on the model), so power during those spontaneous wild camping getaways will be no problem.\nSleeping and socialising in the Auto-Trail Adventure\nThe\nAuto-Trail Adventure\nis a great camping crossover, and there are a number of key features which make life on the road that little bit more luxurious.\nPop-top roof\nThe range includes a pop-top roof, which is an ultra-convenient gas strut assisted elevating roof you can raise to provide some all-important extra headroom height in the ceiling space. It also gives the vehicle four berths, as it provides an additional area for an elevated bed with comfort springing, ventilation, reading lights and USB charge points.\nAdditional sleeping\nDown below is another bed – the spacious rear lounge converts when it’s time to sleep, creating a convenient bunk bed layout. A good night’s rest is guaranteed in these comfortable beds.\nSwivel cab seats\nThere are also four travelling seats (including the two in the cab, which swivel when the vehicle is parked up) to face the campervan’s interior, with a side table offering convenience for crockery to finish off the cosy social space. The two models in the Adventure range – the 55 and 65 – come in at slightly different lengths, with the 65 at 6.36m providing an extra bit of space for a comfortable rear lounge.\nKitchen and washroom\nThe kitchen area features a camper-style two-ring hob and stainless steel sink combo along with a grill / oven (up to 180). The Dometic 8-series absorption fridge features a removable freezer box (should you want the 85-litre capacity for chilling only). There’s also a worktop extension, cutlery drawer, an overhead locker and a pair of floor lockers (one of these is handily shelved out).\nThe washroom space is used cleverly and provides more than you might reasonably come to expect from a campervan. There’s a hand-held shower, swivel-bowl toilet on a pedestal, and a mirrored vanity unit below which has a panel that opens to the wash basin. There’s also storage in the form of shelving, hooks, towel and toilet roll holders.\nMore luxury features\nThe 55 and 65 both have the Media Pack fitted as standard. This means that your evenings spent relaxing after a hard day’s adventuring are more than catered for.\nThe whole family can chill in comfort watching the 21.5” Avtex widescreen TV / DVD, which incorporates digital and satellite tuner (omnidirectional TV aerial with digital signal finder). Never miss a second of your favourite show, even when you’re away from home, or take a couple of your favourite discs with you!\nIn the cab, to make time on the road as comfortable as possible for the driver, the Zenec LCD head unit features a ‘motorhome specific’ sat nav as standard, which makes navigation a whole lot easier.\nA digital radio with integrated microphone plus steering wheel radio controls mean you’re always in command of what you’re listening to.\nThe colour reversing camera makes parking a really simple task.\nAs ever with\nAuto-Trail campervans\nthe quality is in the detail, and the Adventure is a really well-kitted and capable beast that will see you make the most of your time in the wild! Imagine finding somewhere great to base yourself, and going off for a day of activity, and returning to this really special vehicle for your evening of chill time.\nYou might be looking at\nAuto-Trail coachbuilt motorhomes\nor\nAuto-Trail A-class motorhomes\nor thinking about which one could be your next leisure vehicle – but it all depends on what you want it for. If you’re looking for a campervan to elevate those leisure moments, and that valuable time ‘away from it all’ when fun is the frontier to which you’re headed, then the\nAuto-Trail Adventure\nis the range for you.

    "title": "Ducato and Fiat Motorhomes: A Match Made in Heaven | Auto-Trail",
    "content": "Ducato and Fiat Motorhomes: A Match Made in Heaven\nThe Ducato is a van with a forty-year tradition of quality. Built by Fiat, a company with over a century of vehicle excellence to its name, it should be no surprise that the Ducato has been used as the preferred base for hundreds of thousands of\nmotorhomes\n. Roughly three out of four are built on it – which means approximately\n75%\nof motorhomes on the road are Fiat-based. Whichever iteration of the Italian giant’s flagship van it may have been at any given time, down the years the Ducato has been a reliable and brilliant fusion of form and function.\nRefined year upon year to enhance its car-like driving experience, the Ducato is a vehicle which continues to define the domestic van sector. It has a small turning circle so it’s relatively easy for drivers to perform any type of manoeuvre, and the well-balanced chassis, specific suspensions, adjustable steering wheel and hydraulic power steering make for dynamic behaviour in road conditions of all kinds. The Speed Limiter and Cruise Control plus various other systems in place within the Ducato are designed for driver and passenger safety. These include driver and passenger airbags, ESC with ABS and EBD; Load Adaptive Control (the system that recognises the load), HBA, roll-over mitigation (the system that monitors handling and controls elements to keep the vehicle stabilised) and Hill Holder (the brake / pedal system designed to make hill starts easier by preventing rollback).\nThe Ducato base was designed in partnership with motorhome manufacturers so that it offers the best integrated base and living area solutions money can buy.\nFiat motorhomes\nhave interior features which are a fusion of creativity and practicality, with features such as the rotating seats for driver and front passenger offering a smart solution to meet the desire to maximise space. The Ducato becomes a lounge, simply by turning these seats round to face toward the interior living area.\nAt\nAuto-Trail\n, we offer many motorhomes which are based on the Fiat Ducato. Here are a few of our favourites…\nThe Auto-Trail Expedition\nBuilt on the new Fiat Ducato Series 8, Euro 6D chassis and featuring a 140bhp engine as standard the Expedition is an all-rounder (with 160bhp, 180bhp & 9 speed automatic gearbox available as cost options). With four models in the range (the C63\n, the C71\n, the C72 and the C\n73\n), each Expedition offers a different layout.\nThe C63\nis 6.34m length, and a four-berth motorhome with a large front lounge including bench seating with scatter cushions and a free-standing table, plus ambient LED lighting and upper lockers (for plenty of storage space to keep all of your travel necessities). The kitchen features a three-burner hob with full oven and grill, a fridge with removable freezer compartment, an inset sink with flush-fitting glass lid and plenty of worktop space as well as storage for cutlery and crockery plus other cooking essentials and food. The washroom features a fully enclosed shower cubicle, wash basin and electric flush toilet.\nThe C71 is 7.25m and a four-berth featuring a rear fixed island bed which can be partitioned off from the rest of the interior to create an en-suite bedroom (though the hi-line version can be a six berth with an over cab bed). The relaxing front lounge makes great use of the cab’s swivelling captain’s chairs for good-sized family social space ahead of the kitchen area which features three-burner hob with full oven and grill, a fridge with removable freezer compartment, a sink and worktop space as well as storage.\nThe C72 has a lounge to the front of the interior, and a second wraparound U-shaped lounge towards the rear, offering great spaces for socialising. The rear lounge can be transformed into a spacious transverse double bed in this 6 berth motorhome. The C72 also includes a well-equipped galley kitchen with hob and a spacious bathroom with standalone shower. The C73\n, meanwhile, offers a transverse rear double bed built over a huge rear garage, plus another fixed bed as well as a lounge area which can also be transformed into a further sleeping area. The highly practical layout of this model is perfect for families or couples who enjoy an active lifestyle, an active couple. A large storage compartment with external access means plenty of space for your adventure equipment.\nThe Auto-Trail Imala\nBuilt on the ever popular Fiat Ducato Euro 6D chassis and featuring a 140bhp engine as standard, the Imala is great to drive, with a practical design which makes it affordable as well as luxurious. There are 160bhp, 180bhp & 9 speed automatic gearbox available as cost options. Four iterations of the Imala are available – the 615, 730, 736, and 736 G.\nThe 615 is a four berth\n(in the Hi-Line variant) or two in the low profile. A large lounge at the front of the vehicle features plenty of overhead storage space over longitudinal seating and a free-standing table, which offers a warm, welcoming space with plenty of room to entertain and enjoy social time together. To the rear of the 615 is a fitted end kitchen with 4-ring hob, oven / grill, microwave, fridge with freezer compartment and a sink with worktop space. A spacious washroom includes separate shower, toilet and basin.\nThe 2 or 4 berth 730  features a fixed rear-island bed which can be partitioned off from the rest of the motorhome to create your own private en-suite, while the 4 or 6 berth 736 features a wraparound u-shaped lounge at the rear of the vehicle which can be converted into a transverse double bed. The 736 G also features a well-equipped galley kitchen (with hob, oven / grill and microwave plus fridge with freezer compartment) as well as a roomy bathroom with standalone shower and fittings to make you feel at home. The 736 G features a large rear garage over which there is a transverse rear double bed. The front lounge can also be transformed into a further sleeping area, and there is also the option to add an over-cab bed with the Hi-Line models."

    "title": "Winterise Your Motorhome: Essential Steps to Prepare for the Cold Season | Auto-Trail",
    "content": "Winterise Your Motorhome: Essential Steps to Prepare for the Cold Season\nAlong with motorhome security, a significant risk to your motorhome is the weather. As winter approaches, it’s crucial to prepare your motorhome for the cold months ahead. Effective winterisation ensures that your beloved motorhome remains in top condition, ready for the adventures that await when the warmer days return. Whether you’re planning to use your motorhome during the winter or store it away, taking the right steps can prevent costly damage whilst ensuring your comfort and safety.\nDrain Down Your Motorhome\nBefore the freezing temperatures arrive, it’s essential to drain down your motorhome’s water systems. Water left in pipes, tanks and fixtures can freeze and cause damage – often at great expense. Here’s how to do it:\nDrain the freshwater tank\nFirst, empty the freshwater tank – either by using the onboard pump to remove the water or by opening the drain valve.\nDrain the water heater\nNext, make sure to drain the water heater. This is essential, given that it can be one of the most expensive motorhome parts to replace. Turn off the heater and allow it to cool before opening the drain plug.\nIf you have a Carver Boiler, the drain tap will be located on the outside of the flue cowl; with a Truma Ultrastore boiler, this will be a yellow lever in the boiler compartment; with a Truma Combi boiler, look out for the automatic drain valve in the boiler/nearby compartment – this will usually drain on its own at temperatures of 5°C or below.\nOpen all faucets\nOpen all faucets and fixtures (including the shower, sink, and toilet) to allow any remaining water to drain from the pipes.\nUse compressed air\nAfter draining, use compressed air to blow out any residual water from the lines. This additional step will help prevent any water from freezing in the system.\nUse Adequate Antifreeze\nTo protect your plumbing system from freezing, it’s crucial to use motorhome antifreeze. Unlike automotive antifreeze, motorhome/RV antifreeze is non-toxic and safe for potable water systems.\nBypass the water pump\nDisconnect the intake hose of the water pump and connect a hose to the antifreeze container.\nPump antifreeze\nTurn on the water pump and use it to pump antifreeze through the plumbing system. Run each faucet until the colour of the antifreeze flows out, indicating that the entire system is protected.\nPour antifreeze in the drains\nPour antifreeze down the sink and shower drains to protect the P-traps.\nClean All Utilities\nEfficiently cleaning and maintaining your motorhome’s utilities before winter sets in not only prevents damp and mould, but also prevents the build-up of dirt which can become even more difficult to remove if neglected for longer periods.\n·\nClean the water tanks\nUse a tank cleaner to remove any residue or bacteria from your freshwater and wastewater tanks. This will prevent odours from developing and ensure clean water for the next season.\nCheck the propane system\nMake sure the propane system is in good working order. Check for leaks and make sure that the regulator and lines are free from damage.\nClean the refrigerator and freezer\nClean the interior of your refrigerator and freezer and defrost if necessary. Leave the doors slightly ajar to prevent mould and odours.\nDrain the black and gray tanks\nEmpty the black and gray water tanks completely and add a small amount of antifreeze to prevent any remaining liquids from freezing. Flushing the gray tank after the black tank helps you to flush any solids stuck in the sewer hose.\nProtecting the Exterior\nDon’t forget to take care of the exterior of your motorhome to keep it looking as good as new:\nCover or store indoors\nIf possible, store your motorhome indoors. If not, invest in a quality motorhome cover to protect it from snow and ice. Opt for a purpose-made cover that’s breathable and has a soft underside – this will help to prevent condensation when the temperature drops and stop the bodywork from becoming scratched.\nInspect seals and roof\nCheck for any gaps or damaged seals on windows, doors, and roof vents that may arise with age. It’s a good idea to repair or replace them to prevent water infiltration.\nMaintain tires\nEnsure your tires are properly inflated and, if storing the motorhome, use tire covers to protect them from the elements.\nMaintaining Battery Power\nIf your motorhome is going to be out of action for the season, batteries can become discharged entirely, which has the potential to cause permanent damage. You may want to consider disconnecting and taking the leisure battery to a garage where professionals can monitor its state of charge and perform charging as needed. However, it’s best to consult your owner’s manual before proceeding.\nAlternatively, you may choose to still take your motorhome for a run out regularly to recharge both batteries, which not only benefits the overall health of your motorhome but also helps maintain the charge levels of both the vehicle and leisure batteries. You could also install a solar roof panel with a minimum output of 40W can be a practical solution to keep both batteries topped up while in storage, even during the less sunny winter months. However, make sure to verify that your control system permits the solar panel to charge both the vehicle and leisure batteries.\nHow to store your motorhome for winter\nThough you may of course, wish to use your motorhome all year round, the steps outlines above can be a life saver when it comes to motorhome maintenance. If you wish to take a break over winter, you’ll want to think about storing your vehicle safely. You may wish simply to store your motorhome at home if you have adequate space on the driveway – it’s not a good idea to park your motorhome on the roadside for extended periods. Alternatively, many of\nour Auto-Trail stockists\nhave their own storage facilities on site. Simply look for your nearest dealership and get in touch to book a spot.\nBy following these steps, you can protect your investment and be ready to hit the road when the weather warms up. Start your winterization process early to avoid any last-minute issues. Thorough preparation now will help you enjoy your motorhome for years to come!\nRelated guides\nBUYING GUIDE\nMotorhomes Under 3,500kg: Everything You Need to Know\nBUYING GUIDE\nWhat Licence Do I Need to Drive a Motorhome?\nBUYING GUIDE\nMotorhome and Campervan Essentials: Your Ultimate Packing List"

    "title": "Getting away in winter: A motorhomer’s guide | Auto-Trail",
    "content": "Getting away in winter: A motorhomer’s guide\nFor some people, a motorhome is a ‘fair seasons only’ leisure vehicle, used during the spring and summer when the weather is almost certainly decent. During autumn and winter it’s more than likely to be parked up or put into storage (after a good winterisation process, of course). For other people, the winter actually represents a great chance to get out and see things in their often surprisingly beautiful off-peak prime. A motorhome is more than capable of handling winter conditions – and, in this edition of our blog, we’ll focus on a few tips to help travellers along the way.\nThings to pack on a winter motorhome trip\n1. Grip mats\nTaking along some grip mats might seem a little extreme at first, but it’s a very sensible idea. You don’t really know exactly what conditions are going to greet you, how they might change, or where you choose to park up. Grip mats will provide traction and therefore are a must-have bit of kit for dealing with off-road surfaces or inclement weather. By adhering to the terrain and the vehicle tyre, they’ll provide the necessary traction for your wheels to move and get your motorhome moving.\n2. Wellies and waterproofs\nIt’s fairly obvious that conditions outside of the motorhome could become a little bit unsuitable for day-to-day footwear. Rather than take a chance on ruining those terrific suede boots you’ve just bought, or getting your expensive branded trainers filthy, taking along a pair of wellington boots is a must. Similarly, making sure you take some waterproofs with you is going to pay off if the weather turns wet and wild. A good waterproof coat with a fleece inner will keep you warm and dry.\n3. Survival kit\nNot that anything drastic will go wrong during your trip, but it’s worth having a survival kit onboard just in case you find yourself cut off or in trouble, or should you find that there are domestic problems (the onboard heating system or lighting system fails, for example). This kit should include a torch, blankets, medical supplies (plasters, bandages, cough medicine, painkillers, etc). Including a set of tools is highly recommended, too – socket set, screwdrivers, WD40 etc. You should also carry breakdown gear as part of your survival kit – warning triangles etc.\n4. Screen cover and de-icer\nThis is a really smart idea on those cold nights. Who really wants to have to get out of their motorhome the next morning and spend ages de-icing and clearing the windscreen before setting off. That’s a lot of valuable time wasted, as well as a lot of faff. A large cover to put over your windscreen will keep off most of the frost – or even snow – and leave you with a minimal amount of de-icing to do. If your budget will stretch to it, and if you’ve got the room to store it once you’re on the move again (i.e. a garage), try and make sure you buy one that also covers the engine, bonnet and front end.\nWhere to go in winter in your motorhome\nMany campsites will be shut during the winter, due to the fact that most people take their holidays in the summer. However, fuss free, you will certainly be able to find places to stay if you take the time to do some research on the internet. Narrow down the area that you would like to travel to, and search for campsites within it. For our recommendations, here, we’ve chosen what we consider to be three key areas of the UK which are as beautiful during the winter months as they are during the summer months – and sometimes even more so!\nLake District\nWith spectacular views and a truly charming atmosphere, the Lake District is a region and national park in Cumbria, up in the north west of England. It’s famous for its lakes and mountains, reminiscent of Scandinavia, and even its historic associations in the world of literature. There are several charming market towns to explore (Kendal, Ambleside and Keswick etc) where you will find traditional inns ready to welcome you. During the winter this region can boast some truly glorious scenery (some of the very best that the UK has to offer). Motorhoming here is a true pleasure.\nSnowdonia\nThis mountainous region (otherwise known as Eryri) in north west Wales is also a national park containing all 15 mountains in Wales which stand over 3000 feet high (including the country’s highest, Snowdon). Like the Lake District, the views here are stunning, with the natural environment at its best. Travelling in a motorhome or campervan is a great way to discover many different locations and see them in their unspoiled winter beauty.\nCairngorms\nOne of Scotland’s most appealing mountain ranges sits in the eastern Highlands and is closely associated with the mountain Cairn Gorm (hence, of course, the name). The Cairngorms has an abundance of mountains, forest paths, rivers, lochs, wildlife spots, ancient fortresses and – importantly – friendly distilleries to visit. It also boasts five of the UK’s six highest mountains and 55 munros – mountains over 3,000 ft. Visiting in a motorhome will reward you with terrific views every day, wherever you travel.\nAlthough winter might not be the most obvious season to take an extended trip in your motorhome, it can be the most rewarding – certainly if you visit the areas we mentioned. You will see these incredible natural environments in all of their winter glory – and not everyone can say the same. Even better, if you travel in an Auto-Trail you will be experiencing the very best that motorhoming can offer.\nRelated guides\nBUYING GUIDE\nMotorhomes Under 3,500kg: Everything You Need to Know\nBUYING GUIDE\nWhat Licence Do I Need to Drive a Motorhome?\nBUYING GUIDE\nMotorhome and Campervan Essentials: Your Ultimate Packing List"

    "content": "A Guide for Auto-Trail Owners\nYou’ve Collected Your Motorhome or Campervan, Now What?\nWhere to start with your new motorhome or campervan\nCongratulations on collecting your brand-new Auto-Trail motorhome or campervan! The open road awaits, and you’re about to embark on incredible adventures and unforgettable experiences. Before you hit the road, it’s essential to familiarize yourself with a few key steps to ensure a smooth and enjoyable journey. In this blog post, we’ll walk you through some important tasks, tips, and tools specifically tailored to Auto-Trail owners.\nCalculate Weight Capacity\nUnderstanding the weight capacity\nof your motorhome or campervan is crucial for both safety and performance. Auto-Trail offers a convenient online tool, the Auto-Trail Weight Calculator, which helps you determine the payload and ensure you don’t overload your vehicle. By inputting various items and equipment you plan to carry, the calculator provides an accurate estimate of your motorhome’s weight distribution.\nProper Storage\nWhen your motorhome or campervan is not in use, storing it correctly ensures its longevity and minimizes the risk of damage. Find a secure and suitable location that protects it from the elements. If possible, keep it covered to shield it from dust, debris, and UV rays. Make sure to follow any specific guidelines outlined in your Auto-Trail owner’s manual for optimal storage conditions.\nRead the Handbook\nBefore embarking on your first journey, take the time to thoroughly read the\nAuto-Trail owner’s handbook\n. This comprehensive resource contains valuable information about the features, functions, and maintenance of your specific model. Familiarize yourself with essential systems, such as electrical, plumbing, heating, and waste management, to ensure you can troubleshoot any potential issues during your travels.\nEssential Packing\nCareful planning and packing can significantly enhance your motorhome or campervan experience. Consider the duration of your trip, the number of passengers, and the destinations you plan to visit. Pack essential items such as bedding, toiletries, kitchenware, clothing, and food provisions. Don’t forget to include safety equipment like a first aid kit, fire extinguisher, and emergency tools. It’s also a good idea to bring entertainment options, such as books, games, or outdoor equipment, to make the most of your downtime.\nCheck out the Auto-Trail packing list\nto give you some ideas of items you might need on your travels.\nLoading the Habitation Area\nTo ensure a safe and stable journey, it’s important to load the habitation area of your motorhome or campervan correctly. Distribute the weight evenly and place heavier items lower down and closer to the vehicle’s centre of gravity. Secure loose objects to prevent them from shifting during transit. Be mindful of weight restrictions and never exceed the recommended payload limits.\nTop Tips and Things Not to Forget:\nCarry out regular maintenance checks on your Auto-Trail motorhome, including tire pressure, fluid levels, and engine health.\nFamiliarise yourself with the specific driving characteristics of your vehicle, as motorhomes and campervans may handle differently than regular cars.\nPlan your travel routes in advance, considering factors like road restrictions, height limits, and narrow passages that may not be suitable for larger vehicles.\nKeep a checklist of important items to bring, including passports, travel documents, insurance details, and roadside assistance contacts.\nConsider investing in a motorhome-specific navigation system or mobile apps that provide information on campsite locations, amenities, and local attractions.\nOwning an Auto-Trail\nmotorhome\nor\ncampervan\nopens up a world of freedom and adventure. By taking the time to understand your vehicle’s weight capacity, storing it correctly, reading the handbook, packing essential items, loading the habitation area safely, and remembering a few valuable tips, you’ll be well-prepared for a smooth and enjoyable journey. Embrace the freedom of the open road and create lifelong memories as you explore the world in your Auto-Trail motorhome or campervan.

    "content": "Read our handy packing guide to help you prepare for your next Spring getaway…\nDays are getting longer, flowers are blooming and holiday excitement is in the air! Planning a motorhome getaway this Spring doesn’t need to be stressful, which is why we have put together a handy packing guide just for you.\nFirst thing’s first – understanding your leisure vehicle’s maximum weight limit. This is hugely important because driving over the maximum weight could invalidate your insurance and lead to prosecution if you are involved in an accident.\nHow do I find out the maximum weight of an Auto-Trail vehicle?\nIt couldn’t be easier! Simply open the bonnet using the lever inside the passenger door and you will find the maximum weight written inside.\nHow do I use the maximum weight to work out how much luggage I can pack?\nWhen you purchased your Auto-Trail vehicle, you would have been given some paperwork with a ‘mass in running order’ weight on it. This includes everything needed to drive the vehicle (fuel, driver, engine fluid etc.)\nThe difference between your maximum weight and mass in running order weight is called the ‘motorhome payload.’ In other words, this is how much additional weight you can add to the vehicle before it becomes illegal to drive.\nAbsolutely anything you add to the vehicle is included in your payload figure (e.g. luggage, additional passengers, food, water, gas, pets, bikes, towels etc).\nTop Tip:\nUse our online\nweight calculator\nto help you work out your remaining payload!\nWhat is the best way to load a motorhome for stress-free travel?\nIn simple terms, go from bottom to top and start with the heaviest and bulkiest items first. Things like bikes, dog crates, outdoor furniture etc. are always the most awkward to fit in, so make sure they are secure before thinking about smaller items. It is also a good idea to get breakables in and secure early on.\nWeight distribution is important – you don’t want all the heavy items to one side or end of the vehicle. The heaviest items are best situated between the axles and the tyres should be inflated to the fully laden condition.\nWhen putting items in cupboards, the tighter you pack them, the less likely they are to slide about. Also make sure to bring your most used items to the front for easy access. Tea towels are a great way to stop cutlery and pans rattling as you drive.\nOnce everything is in, close and secure all lockers, cupboard doors, roof lights, drop leaf tables and sinks, windows, fridge and gas bottles. Tables should be stored in the dedicated storage area (if your vehicle has one). Turn off the gas bottle at the isolation valve in the LPG compartment* and switch the fridge to 12V. Leaving curtains and blinds open is always a good idea to aid visibility when driving.\nIt might be worth driving down your road and back and testing the brakes to make sure everything stays where you put it!\n*Your vehicle may be fitted with a special type of regulator that allows the gas to remain turned on whilst you are driving. Your dealer will be able to advise you about this.\nTop Tip:\nSNACKS! If you are doing a long drive or just want to make a short one more enjoyable, remember to keep some snacks and drinks in the cab.\nI’m ready to go!\nCongratulations, the hard work\npacking everything\ninto the van is complete and we hope you have a wonderful time on your getaway.\nNot sure what music to listen to on the way? We have created the\nultimate road trip playlist\nto get you in the motorhome holiday mood. View it here and make sure to download it to your phone if you have limited mobile data."

    "content": "A Literary Odyssey Through the Inspirational Lake District\nThe Lake District is famous for its stunning landscapes that have a timeless beauty. The changing weather enhances its charm, with sunlight and shadows creating a surreal atmosphere. The untouched nature, calm lakesides, and expansive views have remained unchanged for centuries. This is why the Lake District becomes a source of literary inspiration.\nAdding a narrative to your road trip can make it more meaningful. It’s like reading a book where your journey gains depth, characters, and a plot. Integrating literary references connects your trip to the history and culture of the places you visit. It helps you understand the significance of each location better. Narratives also stir emotions. When you align your journey with the stories of authors or characters from literature, you feel their emotions and experiences.\nThe Lake District has been a muse for some of the most important literary works.

The Lake District, a realm of natural splendour in England, offers a diverse range of activities for visitors. Here are some top recommendations:\n– Discover Lake Windermere, England’s largest lake.

    "title": "Why do People Choose a Motorhome With a Garage? | Auto-Trail",
    "content": "Why do People Choose a Motorhome With a Garage?\nFor most people, motorhoming means a lot of time spent within the vehicle itself. A certain amount of driving for everyone is to be expected, of course – but for some people spending most of their leisure time in the vehicle is preferable too. Proper ‘home-from-homing’ – living a normal daily domestic life from the comfort of the sofa, never venturing too far, but parked up in today’s beautiful location.\nOthers, though, love to park up and venture further afield – perhaps on a bike or, if they’re at the beach, with some surf or marine equipment. These are the people most likely to immediately opt for a vehicle which has its own garage – but we believe buying one is something everybody should consider. Here’s why…\nStorage for your adventure stuff\nGarages on motorhomes are externally accessible storage areas, meaning you have a highly convenient option to take along all the fun and adventure gear you need. All of those pieces of equipment which are just too large and cumbersome to fit into the ‘normal’ part of the motorhome, and all the bits that you don’t want lying around – skis, football nets, cricket sets. If you have a motorhome with a garage you can take all these on trips with you, without worrying about compromising your relaxed enjoyment of the living quarters. No-one wants to go for a shower to find it’s full of surf-boards or be confronted with a kayak in the kitchen or visit the loo and have to compete for reading room with a bike!\nStorage for everything else, too!\nNobody likes the thought of that huge and untidy mass of random stuff crammed into their spare room, under the stairs or in the shed. Nonetheless this phenomenon does occur more often than anyone would like to admit – and it’s always a good feeling to get it sorted out. Tidiness is key for great peace of mind and for enjoyment of your space, so you’ll really want to keep the living areas in your motorhome as free from clutter as possible. A\nmotorhome garage\nis the answer. It’s ideal for storing extra luggage or (if you have unpacked your luggage into the fitted wardrobes within the vehicle) your suitcases. If you’re planning on spending some of your break socialising, relaxing and dining just outside your motorhome, the garage is a great place to store your BBQ, too!\nMess-free living\nIf you’re down at the beach you won’t have to worry about sand and seawater getting inside the motorhome and messing up the furniture, as you can use the garage to store your wetsuits once you’ve stripped down and dried them outside the vehicle, as well as other shore clothes you’ve been wearing. You can also use it to store your buckets and spades, windbreaks, inflatables and life jackets. In essence, a motorhome with a garage could be thought of as a utility space as well as a storage facility, and it offers the freedom to transition from the outdoors to back indoors without any issues.\nConvenience for the less abled\nA motorhome garage could also be used to store living aids such as mobility scooters or wheelchairs – and because of this convenience there will be more opportunity, more scope, for a fulfilling holiday or trip for those less abled.\nIt’s a dog’s life\nThe garage of your motorhome could also double-up as the chill-out space for your dog, the area it knows is its own, when you’re outdoors. Dogs do like to have a space to retreat to, perhaps for their nap, as it’s tiring worshipping their owners all day! The garage space might also be the best place for your family to feed the dog, too. It will certainly also offer a better place for you to clean and dry your dog after being on the beach or on a muddy hike, or in the rain or river!\nStay within the law\nYou should bear in mind the extra weight of the items you’ll be taking along on your trip and storing in the garage, so that you can make sure to stay within the acceptable payload for your motorhome. Driving an overladen vehicle is dangerous – and illegal – and so you should ensure you don’t exceed the maximum capability as well as making sure that the weight is distributed evenly, not more than any individual axle load.\nBuying a motorhome with a garage\nreally does extend the idea of vehicles giving a proper home-from-home experience. The garage will change your perception of what’s possible on trips and holidays, as the whole experience will be so much more convenient and fuss free. In this brief guide we hope to have given you several ideas of how the garage is suitable for use, and the kind of things you can store in it, thus relieving the interior of clutter and allowing you a much more relaxing holiday, short break or once in a lifetime trip!"

    "content": "How Can I Look Round A Motorhome?\nYou’ve had a fantastic idea: You’ve decided that you’re going to buy a motorhome. Perhaps you’ve got friends who already own one who’ve been regaling you with stories of terrific times spent out on the road enjoying themselves. Maybe you’ve even been on holiday with them and had a little taste of the enjoyably itinerant lifestyle for yourself. It could be that you saw a motorhome in a TV show or film and were attracted to the idea of ownership.\nWhichever way it was that the idea came to you, it’s a really good one to have had! But what is the next step?\nFinances\nCheck your finances, of course, and work out whether you are in a position to be able to afford a motorhome. You may have the total funds up front and available, but if not you could bear in mind that you may be able to secure funding in the form of a loan from your bank or another financier. Some of\nour dealerships\noffer finance on UK motorhomes, too.\nFinding\nOnce you know money is available to buy a new motorhome, the next step is actually finding one you would like to own. How do you do that? Simple. You can take a look online. You may find one of our pre-owned Auto-Trail motorhomes on social media marketplaces, or perhaps even on online auction sites. That way, you might come across something which is very close to suitable.\nYou could also use a search engine to find dealerships, and by doing that you’re more likely to find a motorhome which is ideal as you will have a lot more choice. Here at Auto-Trail you will be able to find the UK dealerships which handle our vehicles, and which ones, by using\nour handy stockist network tool.\nFeeling\nThere’s nothing quite like having a look around a motorhome to work out whether it has the right fixtures and fittings to facilitate how you want to live when you’re out and about, helping you gauge whether it feels right for you. You can easily have a look round when you visit the dealership, but what about those people that isn’t an option for? Are there ways they can get a look? Yes, there are…\nFilms\nOn our website, there are 360 videos for each model. If you’re not sure what that means, we’ll explain. 360 videos are also known as surround, immersive or spherical videos where an omnidirectional camera has recorded a view in every direction at the same time.\nWhen you play a 360 video back on a flatscreen digital device such as a computer monitor, a tablet or a mobile phone, you will take control of the viewing direction at any given moment. You will be able to use the cursor or your thumb to alter the direction of view of the image – up and down and from side to side. This gives you an almost ‘real space’ context for the interior of the motorhome, and you will get a much more ‘join the dots’ sense of the interior than you would from a series of photos.\nFamous Venue\nYou can also see our vehicles at the motorhome shows which take place each year at the NEC in Birmingham. These shows represent the opportunity to get up close and personal with many of our motorhomes from manufacturers and dealers. We highly recommend\nchecking it out\nif you want to experience something truly special.\nHere at Auto-Trail we are very proud to have been manufacturing British motorhomes since the 1980s, with our company going from strength to strength. We offer campervans in addition to A-class and coachbuilt motorhomes which have been built with quality, functionality, power and performance in mind.

    "title": "Why is a Fiat Motorhome such a good choice? | Auto-Trail",
    "content": "Why is a Fiat Motorhome such a good choice?\nAuto-Trail manufactures most of its motorhomes on the Fiat chassis.\nThis enduringly popular and award-winning base is robust and reliable, building on the renowned Italian firm’s decades of manufacturing experience and engineering excellence.\nWho are Fiat?\nIt’s a name you will no doubt already know, as Fiat has been a global icon for more than a century. The name itself is an acronym for Fabbrica Italiana di Automobili Torino, and Fiat was Europe’s largest automobile manufacturer (also the third largest in the world) for more than 20 years, until the car industry crisis in the late 1980s. Fiat reorganised its business in 2007 and, in 2013, was the second largest European automaker by volume produced, and the seventh largest in the world. In 2014 Fiat purchased the American manufacturer Chrysler.\nWhat’s so good about Fiat vehicles?\nWith engineering expertise and a long history providing masses of experience, Fiat is one of the most recognised and popular brands in the world. Their vehicles are renowned for being both capable and reliable, making the Fiat chassis an excellent choice for the majority of motorhomes and campervans here at Auto-Trail.\nThe Fiat Ducato\nThe Fiat Ducato has been sold in over 80 countries worldwide, forming the base of so many\ncoachbuilt motorhomes\n, making it an incredibly popular choice – with good reason.\nIt’s the only vehicle base expressly designed and built to become a motorhome and is a powerful and durable model. The Ducato has been awarded the Best Motorhome Base accolade many times over by Promobil, the specialist magazine that’s a key reference for trends in the motorhome sector. The current Ducato is an evolution of what’s gone before, and is available in three lengths, two wheelbases and three roof heights.\nAuto-Trail built on Fiat\nMany of our vehicles are\nFiat motorhomes\nand\nFiat campervans\n, so we’ve randomly picked a few different ones out to illustrate the versatility of this chassis.\nExpedition 68\nOur debut foray into dedicated sports campers, the Expedition 68 has been created specifically so that cyclists can transport their bikes and equipment on their adventure trips. The 2023 model features a modern, matte ‘Expedition Grey’ finish, giving a sleek and striking appeal – but it’s not just about the aesthetics. Under the bonnet is a 140bhp engine (rather than an entry level 120bhp) to enhance performance, even when the vehicle is loaded with gear. There’s also a 180bhp upgrade available as a cost option when combined with a 9-speed automatic gearbox. Interior fixtures, fittings and features combine to make the Expedition 68 one of our finest.\nV-Line 636 SE\nThis\ntwo berth motorhome\nis one of the larger vehicles in the V-Line range, with a rear lounge as well as a cosy front lounge (complemented by the front cab’s swivel seats). The front table offers a great spot for a quick break or for mealtimes. In terms of the vehicle’s power and performance, the Euro 6D MultiJet 3 engine ensures a comfortable drive when you’re out on the road.\nAdventure 65\nThis campervan benefits from a lengthened rear lounge, giving plenty of sleeping and social space. The bed in the gas strut assisted elevating roof over the living area offers further sleeping accommodation, making the Adventure 65 feel extra spacious thanks to the Cab Plus feature – the preference for additional headroom in lieu of the standard over-cab shelf. This makes the Adventure 65 the perfect vehicle in which to star gaze when relaxing in the captain’s chairs. With a well-kitted kitchen area and washroom, the Adventure 65 is great for families to use as their all-round road tripper.\nFrontier Comanche\nWith the option to sleep up to six, the this spacious motorhome is the ultimate choice for larger families. The Frontier Comanche showcases the very best of home-style living, with a rear bedroom featuring an island bed, an L-shaped kitchen, separate washroom and lounge space with parallel seating. Coming in at 8.79 metres in length, there’s plenty of space to enjoy life on the road, with our highest specification yet! The sleek exteriors can also be customised upon order, with five Fiat colour options to choose from to really make it your own!\nExpedition C72\nAnother superb choice in our six-berth range is the Expedition C72. With over-cab sleeping, and additional convertible beds at ground level, the design of this coachbuilt motorhome frees up even more floor space for living. Supreme quality can be found at every turn, from the comfortable front lounge and fully-equipped kitchen to the contemporary bathroom with stand alone shower and LED lighting throughout for the perfectly calming atmosphere.\nWhichever Fiat-based vehicle you choose, you are sure to find the combination of our design aesthetics and vehicle lifestyle engineering with the Italian firm’s chassis an irresistible choice.

    "title": "Our Tips and Tricks For Long Haul Travel | Auto-Trail",
    "content": "Our Tips and Tricks For Long Haul Travel\nWhether you’re in an\nA-Class motorhome\nor a converted camper, making sure a lengthy road trip goes smoothly isn’t just about making sure you’ve got enough fuel in the tank and your eyes open while you’re driving.\nThere are several ‘little things’ you can do in advance, and each day, which ensure your on the road experience is as smooth as possible.\nMaintenance\nMake sure that your motorhome is up to its optimum holiday standard. Tyre pressure should be ‘just right’ (as per the manual for your model). The lights (indicators, too) should all be in good working order – and so should the brakes! The engine might need some oil, the radiator might need some water – and so on. You could get a professional involved, here, if you think it is necessary. Book in for a service or check-up with a garage that deals with leisure vehicles and\nlarge motorhomes\nif you feel that something may require attention before making your next big trip.\nMaps\nOkay, this is the digital age, and everyone loves a\nsatellite navigation system.\nOne of these electronic devices hooked up to the clever tin cans in the sky means travel is very easy. A sat nav is brilliant for pointing you in the right direction once a destination is programmed in and telling you when you need to take a turn (etc). Plus, if yours is updating correctly, it’s handy for keeping you notified about the situation on the roads ahead so that you can miss out newly occurring snags and difficulties. But\n[HD1]\nthere’s no real substitute for ‘proper’ maps. The printed kind. The kind you can spread out over the table at breakfast, and physically trace the day’s route with your finger.\nFor a start the physicality of\npaper maps\nmeans they take up a larger area so everything is instantly more visible than on a sat nav screen, and that can only be a good thing. Seeing large and being able to use your finger to run along the route means the information is going to ‘get in’ to the brain. We’re not necessarily suggesting you use paper maps instead of a sat nav – but more so in addition to. Covering all bases, as it were. The downside of paper maps is that they don’t do the whizz-bang stuff that sat navs do. They don’t tell you when to turn or notify you of a diversion due to an accident or other incident.\nSo, take paper maps and use them at the start of the day, before setting off (or the night before, when planning) and as ‘back up’. They’re a great way to get an overall view of your routes.\nIntercontinental prep\nIf you’re going travelling around Europe rather than staying in the UK, there are various things you must do beforehand:\nMake sure your passport is up to date.\nEnsure you have the correct UK sticker on the back of your vehicle.\nObtain GHIC or EHIC (these are health insurance cards) if you haven’t already.\nMake sure that you have travel insurance and breakdown cover.\nResearch, and be aware of specific travel regulations in each country you intend to visit – and the up-to-date versions of these can easily be found using our old friend the internet.\nWeather appropriate attire\nNothing quite like chucking everything in the back of your vehicle at short notice and heading off into the sunset. However, common sense and even a cursory amount of research can save you a lot of hassle. How much of a disaster would your short break or holiday be if you just sprang into action (from the armchair in your living room to the driving seat of your motorhome, in minutes), and arrived at your destination only to find that it was raining cats and dogs? Or snowing? Or absolutely freezing cold and you haven’t brought a suitable coat?\nA little bit of planning, in this regard, can go a long way. Check the weather forecasts online – there are plenty of easily accessible sites which can help you out, here. Check for the days you will be travelling, staying and travelling back again. Check the area you will be travelling to. All of this specific information should be pretty easy to find. Once you have it, you can plan what is appropriate to take in terms of clothing and footwear (etc).\nObviously if you are travelling across or around Europe you are going to find that conditions can be quite different to here in the UK. So, again, do your homework in terms of the likely weather scenarios you’ll encounter, and take the right steps (pack the right gear)!\nFood\nThe chances are that you will choose to ‘eat out’ at some point while you are on the road. Perhaps you’ll park up at a camping site and cook your own most nights, or perhaps you’ll venture to the nearest town to enjoy the lunchtime cafés and the night-time restaurants. Perhaps the journey is everything and you’ll be spending almost all of your time literally on the road – and so motorway service stations will become meal providers each day.\nOur advice is that if it’s at all possible to plan in advance then you should. Think about the meals you are likely to have in your motorhome. It’s a simple equation: how many days will you be away, how many meals a day will actually be in your motorhome – and therefore how much food do you need to take? It’s no good taking thirteen tins of beans and only two bread buns if you’re intending to have beans on toast every day. That’s an extreme example, of course, but the principle stands. If you can bear it, plan out your meals in advance and take the food you need.\nHowever, you might be in a position to buy food while you’re travelling. If you’re going to be away for a couple of weeks, you could take ‘long life’ milk with you for your regular cuppa. Or, if you are going to be moving from inhabited place to inhabited place, you might think it better to buy fresh from local shops every couple of days.\nEntertainment\nIf you are bringing your motorhome out of its winterisation phase, you should remember to put the TV and radio or media player back in before you set off. Nothing quite like getting 400 miles away and settling down for the evening to watch that DVD of that great film, only to find that you’ve left the TV or the DVD player back at the ranch. Or the remote control! Don’t forget that either!\nOther important accessories\nReally, what we mean here is make sure you take a first aid kit with you. Plasters, bandages, antiseptic, headache tablets, cold remedies, antihistamine tablets, insect bite spray and so on. All of the ‘quick fixes’ that will make you feel better if there’s illness or minor injury.\nIt’s also worth taking spares of lightbulbs, toilet roll, toothpaste – plus a repair kit if you have a\nmotorhomewith a garage\nor boot rack and you’re taking your bike along too!"

    "content": "What Is The Best Campervan For Hiking?\nHiking is one of life’s great pleasures. Good for physical and mental health, hiking can be an exhilarating way to get close to nature and see the countryside in all of its glory.\nSome hikers stick to their own personal favourite tried-and-tested routes – possibly quite close to home. Others prefer to go further afield for the day and hike across new places. Taking it a step further, there are hikers who make a weekend break or longer holiday out of it, moving around from place to place, taking hikes along different routes.\nThis begs happy questions: How do they get there? Where do they stay overnight? Here at Auto-Trail we have the happy answer:\nAuto-Trail’s V-Line Sport.\nWhy the V-Line Sport Is Great For Hikers\nThe Auto-Trail V-Line Sport is the perfect campervan for hikers, adventurers or activity lovers who require a performance vehicle which can get them easily from A to B. This one is built on the updated Fiat Ducato Series 8, Euro 6D chassis and features a 140bhp engine as standard. Like all Fiat campervans, it’s a great performer. You also need a vehicle which is the perfect accommodation for the duration of a trip. A vehicle which will be a comfortable home-from-home but also be up to the job of carting around activity gear and acting as a hub.\nThe V-Line Sport, available in three models, meets this need with a range of features which have been specifically designed to facilitate the lifestyle of ‘the outdoor type,’ including the storage of sports and activity equipment. Three key features include:\nBespoke moulded GRP rear with gas strut boot.\nThis allows for very easy access to the external storage space. You can utilise this space to store muddy boots, rain-soaked jackets, fishing rods, nets and so on.\nShower point.\nAn external shower point is a welcome features of the exterior of the V-Line Sport, as it offers the opportunity to ‘clean things off’– perhaps your boots, activity equipment or dog (an animal which seems to be able to locate a patch mud from a mile away). An external shower is also a great way to cool off on a hot day.\nBBQ point.\nLocated in the boot, and easily connectable, is the V-Line Sport’s gas BBQ point. This handy feature enables alfresco dining – you can cook freely outdoors, and mealtimes will be more sociable for all concerned.\nWhy The V-Line Sport Is Also A Great Home-From-Home\nA good outdoorsy break is not just about the activities you undertake away from the motorhome, it’s also about how the motorhome performs in those moments you need to relax, unwind and recover from an exerting day. This could mean ‘chilling out’ with a glass of wine in a camper chair next to the motorhome, waiting for the sun to go down over some magnificent view. Or it could mean cosying up inside the motorhome itself for some TV time, board games or reading. You could upgrade to include the Media Pack which features options for your entertainment.\nThe u-shaped lounge at the rear of each edition of the V-Line Sport offers a wonderful social space, where travellers can gather round the table to enjoy each other’s company, or where you can sit with your maps and guidebooks to plan out tomorrow’s hike. ‘Aircraft style’ lockers overhead mean there’s plenty of storage space for all of your bits and pieces – books, maps, tablets, board games and so on.\nPlenty of window space around this area will provide you with great views or, in the evenings, a delicate natural ambience. In addition, the 636 Sport has an additional handy seating area and table located just behind the driver’s seat.\nWhen it’s time to go to bed, the V-Line Sport caters as the convertible lounge bench seating in the rear of the vehicle transforms into a spacious and comfortable double. With the wonderful views possible through the windows surrounding this area of the motorhome, cosy nights under the constellations are a must! Even more impressive if stargazing is your thing, is the Panoview, available as a cost option. This is an innovative panoramic rooflight above the driving area, which floods the campervan with wonderful natural light, providing an awe-inspiring view of the heavens.\nThe V-Line Sport For The Great Outdoors\nUltimately, if you love the outdoors and wish to get the most out of adventures in your new motorhome, then the V-Line Sport is almost certainly the one for you, with a cleverly designed vehicle which offers plenty of space, enough comfort to take for granted, and lots of features designed to enhance your way of living."

    "content": "Why More Brits Are Choosing Motorhomes for Their Holidays in 2025\nSummer 2025 with Auto-Trail\nAs the travel landscape continues to evolve, more and more Brits are rethinking the way they holiday. With international travel costs rising and airport chaos, the idea of\nfreedom on four wheels\nhas never looked more appealing.\nIn 2025, the UK is seeing a surge in motorhome travel – and at Auto-Trail, we’re seeing more people than ever fall in love with the idea of taking the road less travelled.\nWhether it’s escaping into nature, exploring hidden gems closer to home, or enjoying the freedom to go wherever the road takes you, here’s why motorhome holidays are capturing the imagination of so many – and why now is the perfect time to explore our new\nAuto-Trail 2025 motorhome and campervan range\n.\nThe Rise of the Great British Staycation\nStaycations aren’t just a passing trend (forget the COVID-19 stampede). Over the past couple of years, British holidaymakers have rediscovered the beauty of our own backyard – from the rugged coastlines of Cornwall to the rolling hills of the Lake District. In 2025, staycations are stronger than ever, but now it’s all about\nhow\nyou stay.\nHotels and holiday parks are great, but they can’t offer the same sense of freedom, privacy, or spontaneity as a motorhome. With your own vehicle, you can wake up to a sunrise by the sea, enjoy breakfast in a secluded forest, and chase the weather – all without unpacking a suitcase more than once.\nAuto-Trail owners tell us time and again that what they love most is\nfreedom\n. And we’ve built our new season range around that idea.\nWhy Motorhome Holidays Are Booming in 2025\nThere are a few big reasons why more people are choosing the motorhome lifestyle this year:\nCost-Effective Adventures\nWith fuel prices stabilising and the cost of living remaining a key concern, families and couples are turning to motorhomes for better value getaways. You avoid expensive hotel bills, eat your own meals, and pay only for the sites and experiences you choose.\nPlus, with a modern, efficient motorhome like those in the Auto-Trail 2025 line-up, your running costs are lower than you might expect. You can even finance the vehicle on our own finance product Advance at a low APR of just 7.9%.\n<< GO TO THE FINANCE CALCULATOR HERE >>\nFlexibility and Spontaneity\nForget fixed itineraries, or struggling for flight dates. A motorhome gives you the freedom to change your plans at a moment’s notice. If the forecast is rainy in the Lakes but sunny in Devon? Head south. Want to stay an extra night somewhere beautiful? Easy.\nThis level of flexibility is something traditional holidays just can’t match – and it’s perfect for those with a sense of adventure.\nComfort and Convenience\nModern motorhomes aren’t what they used to be. The Auto-Trail 2025 range is designed with comfort in mind: luxurious upholstery, smart storage, integrated tech, efficient heating, and stylish kitchens and bathrooms.\nWith everything you need under one roof, you can enjoy five-star comfort on the move –  whether you’re parked up in the Highlands or beside a Cornish cove.\nConnection with Nature\nThere’s something deeply satisfying about pulling up at a quiet site, opening the doors, and soaking in nature. No noisy hotel corridors or crowded lobbies – just you, your motorhome, and the world outside your window.\nWith many Auto-Trail layouts featuring panoramic windows and rear lounges, you’re perfectly placed to take in every sunset, starry sky, or misty morning.\nIntroducing the Auto-Trail 2025 Range\nAt Auto-Trail, we’ve been designing and building premium motorhomes and campervans in the UK for over 40 years – and our 2025 range is our most advanced and exciting yet.\nWhether you’re a first-time buyer or looking to upgrade, there’s something for every kind of adventurer:\nExcel: Sleek, Compact, and Versatile\nPerfect for couples, small families or solo explorers, the 2025 Excel combines smart design with agile handling. Don’t let the compact size fool you – it’s packed with clever features and contemporary styling.\n<< VIEW THE EXCEL RANGE HERE >>\nExpedition Campervans: Rugged, Ready, and Road-Trip Friendly\nA hit with adventurous couples, or younger travellers and digital nomads, the Expedition range offers campervan convenience with bold, go-anywhere looks. Great for wild camping, festival weekends, and long-haul adventures.\n<< VIEW THE EXPEDITION CAMPERVAN RANGE >>\nF-Line and Imala: Family Friendly and Spacious\nNeed more room to stretch out? Our F-Line and Imala ranges offer versatile layouts with fixed beds, rear lounges, and family-friendly features – ideal for longer holidays or travelling with kids.\n<< VIEW THE F-LINE RANGE HERE >>\nFrontier and Grande Frontier: Luxury Touring Without Compromise\nThe jewels in our crown.

It’s your dream hotel suite – on wheels.\n<< VIEW THE FRONTIER RANGE HERE >>\nWhy Now Is the Perfect Time to Buy\nIf you’re considering a motorhome in 2025, now’s the time to start your journey. The demand for new vehicles is strong, and many buyers are planning ahead to ensure delivery before peak holiday season.\nAt Auto-Trail, we work with an expert dealer network across the UK, making it easy to view, test, and order your dream motorhome. Our new 2025 models are built right here in the UK – with craftsmanship, innovation, and your next adventure in mind.\nReady to Explore?

    "content": "The Auto-Trail Owners’ Club Visit the Production Facility on Annual Rally\nThis year’s highly anticipated Auto-Trail Owners’ Club Factory Rally took place last Saturday, the 7th May. Nearly 150 vehicles attended, pitching up at Market Rasen Race Course for three days of socialising and fun. The weekend culminated in over 300 members visiting our manufacturing facility in Grimsby for the opportunity of an in-depth tour of the factory, enjoy a hog roast with friends and raise some money for a good cause.\nThe full factory tours were presented by Auto-Trail’s Quality Manager, Paul Howes, and customers were able to see first-hand Auto-Trail’s unique manufacturing processes from start to finish. These informative and insightful tours are available to the general public too and run on the last Thursday and Friday of each month.\nA total of £690.69 was raised for Auto-Trail’s chosen charity for 2016, The Grimsby Food Kitchen. This local charity started out life as a ‘soup kitchen’, run by Cath and Ken Homewood who reached out to a handful of homeless people in the local area. Ten years later, they regularly serve in excess of 85 people each week. The project is funded entirely by donations from local businesses and the public, and staffed by a dedicated team of volunteers.\nThe money was raised by the participation in numerous events such as a golf putting competition and generous donations by the members of ATOC, Auto-Trail staff, family and friends. All profits will be added to this year’s total and will then be presented to the Food Kitchen at the end of the 2016.\nSaturday’s event was, as always, well supported by several of our suppliers. We would like to thank Truma, Sargents, Thetford, Banner Batteries and Maxview for their time and effort in answering customer’s questions and their donations to the raffle prize table.\nThe evening events took place back at the race course, where the prizes for the competitions during the day and a concours award were presented by the directors.\nStuart Turpin, Joint Managing Director of Auto-Trail and this year’s chairman of the Owners’ Club commented\nThis year’s event was again a wonderful success! Everyone at Auto-Trail really enjoys these rally days at the factory and we would like to thank the Owners’ Club, our staff and suppliers for their exceptional efforts and generosity"

    "title": "Team Auto-Trail Complete Charity Challenge | Auto-Trail",
    "content": "Team Auto-Trail Complete Charity Challenge\nEarlier in July ten members of the Auto-Trail staff embarked on a climb of the highest peak in England, Scafell Pike, in aid of our 2017 charity the Grimsby Food Kitchen.\nThe weather forecast was poor for the whole weekend, but after an arduous four and half hour drive in terrible traffic we arrived at the camp site in high spirits, as the weather was mild and most importantly we could erect out tents in the dry.\nUnfortunately, it didn’t last and the rain began late that night and was keeping a steady pace by morning, leaving a couple of tents which hadn’t seen much action in recent years rather damp. Nonetheless, we dressed in full wet gear and by 8.30am were heading off towards a mountain shrouded in cloud, which definitely made it less intimidating.\nOur site was a good walk from the foot of the mountain, so we were well warmed up by the time we began the climb. We had been warned that Scafell was steep and particularly rocky and that was certainly the reality. The rain didn’t seem to ease at any point and half way up the wind began to pick up too, instigating extra layers hastily being thrown on behind rocks and fellow hikers. Despite the treacherous conditions everyone pushed on to the summit at a good pace reaching the top in around 4 hours.\nAt this point we are feeling quite pleased with ourselves enjoying the fact that the descent was going to be not only easier, but quicker too. Happy days! We seemed to meet larger numbers of our hikers on the opposite side of the mountain and it became apparent that we hadn’t taken the most popular (or easiest) route either or up or down. Thanks Paul.\nAs our route downwards became less populated and the path became less of a path and more of a crumbling ledge, it appeared that due to our eagerness to get home we had made a small error. It turns out that even with two fully functioning GPS devices and several maps you are still able to walk into the completely wrong valley, leading almost in the opposite direction of dry clothes and beer. Disappointment ensued and the GPS consulted. If this wasn’t enough the heavens opened wider and gale force winds began to blows us off our feet. Those of us who had kept reasonably dry up to that point realised the futility of the situation, which was jusy as well as all foot paths had become small rivers. Our small detour entailed a significant climb in very poor conditions back into the correct valley and back down again. There were some glum faces, but no cross words during our six-hour descent, which is a testament to the character of everyone involved.\nWe would like to say a huge thank you to all the members of staff, family members, suppliers and dealers who generously donated to this fantastic cause and made the event a great success. We raised a total of £750 for the Grimsby Food Kitchen, which we will add the year’s total and we hope will make a significant contribution to this worthwhile local charity in 2017."

With 12 tracks at the BSB to complete over the racing season, the Comanche is the ideal leisure vehicle for ultimate relaxation after a long day on the track.\nRussell Hensman, Auto-Trail’s Marketing Manager says\nEveryone here at Auto-Trail is thrilled to continue to support one of the most recognisable international motorcycle teams on circuit.

The trade association for the leisure vehicle industry, the National Caravan Council (NCC), immediately began its #fairmotorhometax campaign. By March 2020, the campaigning was backed by 85 cross-party MPs. NCC Director General, John Lally, said: “We have had extraordinary support from Parliamentarians – too many to mention them all – but in particular Richard Holden MP, Sir David Amess MP, Emma Hardy MP, Karl Turner MP and David Davis MP. Rishi Sunak MP – prior to becoming Chancellor – had also indicated support.\n“Alongside the NCC, its members and the wider industry, these MPs worked tirelessly to reverse this increase, knowing the impact it would have on British manufacturing, on jobs and, potentially, on UK tourism.

The new service, Auto-Trail Refresh, launched this week with the company showcasing what they can do on a 2008 Apache owned by Mr and Mrs Wise.\nRestoration work undertaken on the vehicle includes damage repair, paintwork refresh and a polish and the couple were over the moon when they came to collect. Mrs Wise said, “It is absolutely stunning. We brought it in to have some maintenance done on it and got offered this service. I would advise anybody to have it done because this looks like a new van. I am so impressed, I’m so pleased and I can’t thank them enough.”\nThe range of services available depends on the individual vehicle, age and condition. Customers may benefit from one or a combination of the following: damage repair, new parts, paintwork repair, polish and interior refresh.\nBy booking a consultation with Auto-Trail’s Repair Centre Manager, Clare Osborne, customers are offered a personalised restoration package to fit their budget and requirements. Clare said, “We are delighted to be able to help our customers with the launch of Auto-Trail Refresh and have already had lots of interest in the service. Over time, motorhomes lose their shine, get damaged and need a bit of TLC. By investing in the upkeep of your motorhome, you can prolong its lifespan and add to its value.”\nTimescales depend on order times for parts and availability of the repair technicians and will be discussed during the consultation process. Customers will also receive a complimentary basic valet as part of the process."

    "title": "Auto-Trail Bids Farewell To Dave Thomas | Auto-Trail",
    "content": "Auto-Trail Bids Farewell To Dave Thomas\nAfter 28 years at heart of Auto-Trail, we formally announce the retirement of Managing Director Dave Thomas.\nDuring Dave’s tenure, he led the company through a continuous period of significant growth and success, overseeing the introduction of numerous popular ranges in the ever-popular leisure vehicle market and growing the company’s workforce to over two hundred members of staff at our Grimsby headquarters. Dave’s leadership and contribution to Auto-Trail over a near thirty-year period have been greatly valued and appreciated and he will be deeply missed by all.\nThe staff at Auto-Trail held a surprise retirement presentation for the outgoing Thomas, who closed the day by addressing his workforce, after a look back through the years and stories being told by friends and colleagues celebrating his time at the company.\nIn a statement prior to his departure, Dave Thomas said\nWith the 1st of March being St David’s Day and being Welsh for my sins, it seemed an appropriate day to leave the business. My first foray into the leisure industry was with Auto-homes in Poole, where I was Design Manager and then after a short period, Design Director. Auto-homes had an ageing product line up, but the company had low financial reserves as it had recently gone through a management change and went into receivership. It was a rather turbulent time having a young family, but with other ex-Auto-homes managers and potential shareholders, we formed Herald Motorhomes on the same site. I was then approached by ABI Leisure Group to become Design Director for their motorhome branch, Auto-Trail. Once again, we had an ageing line up of products, but an enthusiastic workforce. With ABI (our parent company) going into receivership, we also folded, just as our new products were starting to create interest. The team at Auto-Trail then completed a joint management buyout with CI of Italy and two years later, CI and Auto-Trail were bought by the Trigano Group and as they say, the rest is history! On leaving Auto-Trail, I shall miss the industry, the people in it and my Trigano colleagues, but now is the time to move on, spend more time with my family and who knows do something else to occupy my time.\nShane Devoy, who joined Auto-Trail in 1998, has been appointed as the new Managing Director and has been joined on the Board of Directors by Commercial Director Scott Stephens & Technical Director Steve Moverley, bringing a combined near-80-years of experience to the table to help shape the future of Auto-Trail.\nCommercial Director Scott Stephens spoke of the respect he has for Dave Thomas and his desire to help continue to progress Auto-Trail.\nMy own experience working with Dave stretches over twenty years now and he is a true gentleman. He is a man who is not just your boss, but is also interested in you, the person, your family, and that really counts for a lot. With the direction of Dave Thomas, Shane Devoy and Steve Moverley, we made a great team which is what we strive to continue with in the future. There is a fantastic team of people here at Auto-Trail who are all striving to supply the best motorhomes in the industry. We could all learn a lesson from Dave. He is one of the founder guys who created this company and made it what it is today. We owe it to him and those before him to ensure this great company continues to be a market leader. Thank you for everything Dave and I wish you a very happy retirement.\nSteve Moverley spoke of his long working life with Dave Thomas and discussed the skills the workforce can relate to from its former Managing Director.\nI just want to thank Dave for his contribution to Auto-Trail and myself for the past twenty-eight years. Dave taught me some valuable skills over the years, which most of our staff can relate to. Get up and start the day as you mean to go on. He is usually one of the first in the office (except from myself!). If something looks half right, it will usually be okay. We have made some questionable decisions over the last twenty-eight years, but Dave has always pushed us to do this, and this is why we have been so successful. One of his favourite sayings is to grasp the nettle. If there is an issue, do not shy away from it, just get stuck in and sort it out and don’t be afraid to make decisions. If you make the wrong one, it is not an issue, just hold your hands up and come up with a backup plan. I would not be here if it were not for Dave offering me a job in the first place. The range of vehicles that we produce now looks very different from the early designs, but the formula still remains very much the same. All the best Dave and I wish you a happy retirement.\nAfter 25 years at the company himself, new Managing Director Shane Devoy has a wealth of experience in the industry and is confident in Auto-Trail’s capability to go from strength-to-strength and grow to meet the ever-increasing popularity of the leisure vehicle industry despite industry-wide constraints.\nDevoy spoke of the economic and supply constraints suffered by the industry but can see positivity on the horizon.\nIn the short term, I see the market holding up at the current levels despite the economic challenges facing consumers. Auto-Trail had been compromised in the last year as a result of the chassis supply constraints, but I see that improving a little in the coming year and Auto-Trail will be able to satisfy customer orders in a reduced timescale. In the next five years, the transition to electric vehicles will rapidly gather momentum across the whole automotive industry. Even though new diesel commercial vehicles will continue to be available beyond 2030, chassis manufacturers have already started the groundwork for an electrified landscape.\nFinally, Shane Devoy had some final words to say about his predecessor on behalf of the team at Auto-Trail.\nI just want to say what a great pleasure it has been working with Dave. The words he has written in the Auto-Trail story are powerful, encouraging and is destined to feature in the management philosophy of ours and future generations. Now, he is about to write another exciting story. One that I am sure will be as spirited and colourful that he has written for this company. On behalf of everybody at Auto-Trail, I want to wish Dave all the very best. Happy retirement Dave and thank you"

We have had great support from Trigano in tough times and have always tried to develop the business through being product and customer focussed.\nDave will be handing over the reins to Shane Devoy, current Finance Director at Auto-Trail. Shane has been with Auto-Trail for over 24 years and will use his extensive experience to drive the business forward.\nShane will be supported by two new members on the Board of Directors, which will form the basis of a local executive committee. Scott Stephens will take up the role of Commercial Director and Steve Moverley will take up the role of Technical Director.\nShane said\nIt has been a pleasure working with Dave for over twenty years. His eye for design detail and business leadership has given us a great product portfolio and a solid foundation that the new management team can continue to build on. We will all miss his quick wit and unique ways of finding solutions to the most complex of problems. Nevertheless, I feel confident that the revised management structure has the strength and depth to continue to grow our business and meet the challenges that may lie ahead.\nDave added\nI couldn’t think of a more capable team to oversee the next stage of Auto-Trail’s journey. I will miss my colleagues and friends, both in and out of the business, and I am confident Auto-Trail will continue to flourish."

And it might have been a case of beginner’s luck, as the 30th anniversary rally was the first Auto-Trial rally Dennis had attended, making it one he will certainly not forget.\nJan Lewis, Auto-Trail Owners Club Director,\n“The 30\nth\nanniversary celebrations were fantastic. We’re very grateful to Vmoto Soco UK for generously donating the CUx scooter to our raffle. It was a super prize and it kept people interested in the raffle all weekend helping raise funds for the Thames Valley Air Ambulance.

    "content": "Auto-Trail Team Up With Uncover Britain\nAuto-Trail are pleased to announce it has teamed up with Uncover Britain to help inspire its owners to explore the wonders of the UK and get the most out of their vehicles.\nDuring English Tourism Week, Auto-Trail ran a poll of its owners to discover their favourite locations to travel in the UK. Despite the Lake District and Yorkshire Dales taking the top spots in England, our poll showed that the most favourite location for our owners in the UK was the Scottish Highlands. Annah Todman of Uncover Britain has provided the following guide delving deeper into what the Scottish Highlands can bring to those wishing to discover its beauty.\nThe Scottish Highlands are a vast, mountainous region in the north-west of Scotland, that has been drawing road trippers to take the journey, because of its stunning scenery, its rich history and culture, and its friendly people.\nThe Highlands is a vast and varied region, with mountains, glens, forests, and lochs, and the highest mountain in the UK, Ben Nevis, is found here. There are many other well-known places that attract visitors here, year after year and these include the Isle of Skye, Fort William, the Cairngorms, Inverness and John O’Groats, to name but a few. The region is also home to many famous castles, including Eilean Donan Castle and Inverness Castle and a great place to learn about Scottish history and culture. There are many museums and historical sites in the region, including the Glenfinnan Viaduct (and now even more recognisable than ever, thanks to Harry Potter!) the Jacobite Steam Train and learn more about the rising of the Jacobites at the Battle of Culloden with a visit to the battlefield.\nThe Highlands is a great place to enjoy the outdoors. There are many opportunities for hiking, camping, fishing, and boating. The region is also home to a number of national parks, including Cairngorms National Park and on the fringe of the Highlands, Loch Lomond and the Trossachs National Park. Depending upon your interests you may be tempted by canyoning in Dollar Glen, Alva Glen and Bruar Water.\nIf you are planning a trip to Scotland, the Highlands is a must-see destination. With its stunning scenery, rich history and culture, and friendly people, the Highlands is a place that you will never forget. There is so much to see and do that you’ll be spoilt for choice and find you have to plan well to suit your interests, taking in to account travel times and available road trip time.\nThere are many options for road trips in the Highlands and many of the routes will require at least a week due to the distances and smaller roads to travel on. To give you a flavour and help you on your way, here’s an outline for a 7-day road trip, suggestion for the southern Scottish Highlands ,with a distance of around 300 miles (500km) and a drive time of around 18 hours in a motorhome:\nDay 1:\n• Begin at Inverness, the gateway to the Scottish Highlands and enjoy a morning looking around the Castle, the Cathedral and one of the many museums.\n• In the afternoon, head to Loch Ness, one of the most famous lakes in the world.\n• Take a boat trip on the loch and look for Nessie, the Loch Ness Monster.\n• Stay overnight in Inverness.\nDay 2:\n• Drive to the Isle of Skye, the largest and most beautiful of the Hebrides Islands, stopping at Eilean Donan Castle on the way.\n• Visit the Old Man of Storr, a dramatic rock formation on the island’s east coast.\n• Hike to Talisker Bay, a stunning beach on the island’s west coast.\n• Stay overnight on Skye.\nDay 3:\n• Drive to the Isle of Mull, the second largest of the Hebrides Islands.\n• Visit the Duart Castle, a 16th-century castle on the island’s east coast.\n• Go on a whale watching tour from the island’s west coast.\n• Stay overnight on Mull.\nDay 4:\n• Drive to the Isle of Rùm, the fourth largest of the Hebrides Islands.\n• Visit the Rùm National Nature Reserve, which is home to a variety of wildlife, including red deer, sea eagles, and seals.\n• Go on a kayak tour of the island’s coastline.\n• Stay overnight on Rùm.\nDay 5:\n• Drive to the Isle of Canna, a small island off the coast of Rùm.\n• Visit the Canna House, a 19th-century mansion on the island.\n• Go on a boat trip to the nearby island of Eigg, which is home to a variety of wildlife, including seals, dolphins, and puffins.\n• Stay overnight on Canna.\nDay 6:\n• Begin your return journey back to Inverness via the Glenfinnan Aqueduct, Fort William and then head over to the Cairngorms National Park with a stop in Aviemore.\n• Stay overnight on Aviemore\nDay 7:\n• As you head return to Inverness, firstly stop to See the Clava Cairns – remains of an ancient cemetery, set on a terrace above the River Nairn.\n• Return to Inverness\nThis itinerary can be customized to fit your interests and budget. For example, if you are interested in history, you could spend more time visiting castles and historical sites. If you are interested in nature, you could spend more time hiking and exploring the national nature reserves. For those looking for a more authentic experience, there is an option of staying overnight in the pub stops, or designated aires rather than campsites. You can really tailor the trip to make it your own. No matter how you choose to spend your time in the Scottish Highlands, you are sure to have a memorable trip.\nOther Highland road trips include the popular North Coast 500 route, which has become a mecca for many. Read more on the\nNC500 route here\n. To enjoy it at its best, taking time to stop and enjoy the views and attractions, two weeks should be allocated to this route, especially given as how far to the north the route begins and this should not be underestimated! Another popular route is the ‘Wild West of Scotland’ starting from Inveraray and heading northwards to Plockton. This route will take you past Loch Lomond and the wonderful Glenfinnan Aqueduct and to the popular Isle of Skye.\nRead more on the Wild West of Scotland road trip here\n.\nIf you are finding the prospect of planning it all daunting, then there are dedicated travel planner aides, such as Uncover Britain, a road trip website with many plans mapped out, that can help you plan your trip more effectively. There are 4 road trips in Scotland and over 20 more around the UK – you’ll be spoiled for choice of where to go next.\nThe planner website replaces several guidebooks and will save you hours of researching and make planning a breeze. You can make a deeper connection using the ‘road trip plans to discover viewpoints and hidden gems on the rout, plus wild swim spots and film and TV spots for a bit of Screen Tourism! You can tailor the trip to your own interests and preferences.\nThe road trip routes, along with details of experiences to enjoy on the way are available with free online membership on\nwww.UncoverBritain.com\n. Upgrading to the paid membership allows online access to the full destination guide for dozens of UK road trips, with overnight stops, hidden gems, viewpoints, wild swimming spots and much more.

    "content": "F-Line F60: awarded best motorhome for under £60,000\nIt’s that time of year again when MMM and What Motorhome run their coveted Motorhome Awards in association with Creation.\nDesigned to recognise the huge improvements in design and construction of motorhomes, the awards are presented to the best models for the coming year to help customers make the right buying decision when looking for a new leisure vehicle.\nThis year, the awards were judged by MMM/What Magazine Editor and YouTube star Peter Vaughan, MMM Deputy Editor Rachel Stothert and Campervan Editor Geneve Brand.\nWe are delighted to announce that Auto-Trail has been selected as the winner of ‘Best Motorhome for Under £60,000’; an award which looks at entry-level motorhomes that are able to combine quality and value for money.\nSteve Moverley, Director of Development, said: “We are thrilled to win the MMM award for best motorhome under £60,000. The F-Line range has a high specification as standard which makes the models very useable. Adding the two optional packs further enhances the usability and comfort level.\n“The F60 is a sub six-metre motorhome that feels spacious for two-person touring on the inside but also drives really well thanks to its compact dimensions. The design brief was to create a layout were the main part of the layout is open and spacious, with a side sofa lounge, a panoramic over cab rooflight and generous well equipped L shaped kitchen including a 3 burner hob fitted above the oven with grill and a full height 142ltr 3 way fridge fitted opposite. Behind the domestic style door to the rear is a spacious bathroom with a separate one piece shower cubicle. With clever design the F60 can also have an optional twin forward facing travelling seat and electric drop down double bed to turn the layout into a true 4 berth vehicle.”\nWhat the judges said\n“Like the bigger models in the range, this is a low-profile motorhome with an over cab sunroof, plus (more unusually) a choice of five cab colours. Standard power unit is the Transit’s 130PS (128bhp) motor, which is more than adequate for a motorhome that’s under 6m in length.\n“In fact, the compact size is a big part of the appeal here, especially as it results in really surefooted handling in combination with the Ford motorhome chassis’ wide rear track and the F60’s ultra-short rear overhang. You’ll have no worries about exceeding your payload here, either – it’s over 700kg in standard spec!\n“Remarkably, the F60 also pulls off the trick of feeling like a spacious full-sized motorhome on the inside. There’s a flat floor throughout the living area (just a small step up into the cab), and the side settee lounge and lack of a fixed table create a very open feeling inside, enhanced by the choice of light-coloured Salinas Oak furniture.”\nRead more\nHighlights of the model\nFord transit chassis\nLow profile with skyline panoramic window\nChoice of five chassis colours\n100ltr fresh water and 80ltr waste water capacity\nFly screens to habitation door and windows\nElectric drop-down bed (£)\nF-Line Drivers Pack (£)\nF-Line Lux Pack (£)\nAvtex Smart television (£)\nMotorhome wif-fi (£)\nTowbar (£)\nExternal gas barbecue point (£)\nSolar panel (£)\nWhat we said\nThe Auto-Trail F60 gives you flexible living with an ingenious design thanks to a large washroom and ergonomic kitchen. The electric drop-down bed means that no space is taken up in the day by a fixed bed, and the vehicle itself is easy to manoeuvre and drive.\nWe are very proud that the F60 has been victorious in this category.

    "title": "A labour of love... | Auto-Trail",
    "content": "A labour of love…\nBy Steve Hawkins\nI acquired a 1979 registered Mercedes 207D Auto-Trail Apache at the start of Covid, as a restoration project to do during lockdown. On completion I started to look into the history of the vehicle, but information is very scarce.\nMy Auto-Trail started life as a 1979 van, and it appears the body was cut down and a coachbuilt body was fitted onto it by Auto-Trail. It is unique due to the curved frontage of the over cab bodywork, as all production models were squared off, this being a cheaper and easier method of construction.\nI dragged it out of a field where it had stood abandoned since 2012. It had been left to rot with a major roof leak and mechanical problems from standing for so long. I did not purchase it because I wanted a motorhome, I had it because I am a vehicle enthusiast. I do not like to see vehicles of interest just left to rot away. Also, it was a project to do whilst lockdowns were taking place.\nI attended to all mechanical and bodywork issues and updated things, but tried to keep the originality of the vehicle. Apart from the colour scheme, which reduces the noticeable appearance of all the aluminium joint trims in the construction of the bodywork, as it was done back in the days when it was coachbuilt.\nAll the work was carried out by myself; mechanical, bodywork, carpentry and upholstery and my home, in the open air. There was more than a little damp, the whole roof had fallen in due to water damage.\nI have updated so many things on Mack to bring it into the 21\nst\ncentury and make it more user friendly. Mods to the engine, its glow plug starter system, and now it starts first time in any weather condition. Any rust in the chassis and bulkhead was chopped out and new steel was welded in. I fitted electrically operated leather heated front seats for comfort and LED lighting throughout so there is less drain on the battery.\nThe Mercedes OM616 diesel engine fitted to the 207D is known for being one of the most reliable engines ever produced and many have gone on to cover over 1,000,000 miles without any problems. Mack has only covered 124,000 in 42 years, so I am hoping this old girl will still be going long after I’m not.\nI have all the MOT certificates going back to 1990 and, according to the logbook, Mack has had 11 previous keepers. There is an Auto-Trail Owners’ Club sticker on the front windscreen, so I am guessing a club member has owned it at some time. I picked her up from a farm near to where I live in South Leicestershire.\nIt was a complete labour of love restoring this old girl, although I call her Mack, she is now dry and is a Merc."
